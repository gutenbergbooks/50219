<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>Apparent typographical errors have been corrected and hyphenation
rationalised. Inconsistent accents have been retained.</p>

<p>The first of two maps precedes the Introduction. It lacks a caption
but probably depicts the Kabul or Khood Cabul Pass. "Boot Khak" named on
the map is probably the "Bhoodkhak" of the Journal.</p>

The second map follows the Appendix. It depicts the British cantonments
at Cabul. </div>

<h2>NOTICE.</h2>

<p class="nodent large"><span class="smcap">The</span> absence of the Author from England, and the consequent impossibility

the oriental words. The greatest care, however, has been taken to adhere
exactly to the original manuscript.</p>

<h2>JOURNAL<br /><span class="x-small">OF</span><br />LADY SALE.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have not only daily
noted down events as they occurred, but often have
done so hourly. I have also given the reports of
the day, the only information we possessed; also
such news as was telegraphed from the Bala Hissar,
or sent in by the King or by Capt. Conolly to the
Envoy; and many other reports brought by
Affghan gentlemen of Capt. Sturt's<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
acquaintance, and by others of lower degree, who having
had dealings with him in the engineer department
and public works, and having received kindness
from him, gave him such intelligence and
warning as was in their power: all of which he
communicated [to his superior officers] at different
times; but the warnings were not attended to;
and as when he gave his advice it was seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
adhered to, he became disgusted, and contented
himself with zealously performing his duties and
making himself generally useful, acting the part of
an artillery officer as well as that of an engineer.
Had poor Sturt's life been spared, it was his intention
to have worked up my Rough Notes,
and to have added much valuable information: he
was too much overworked to afford leisure to give
me assistance at the time. His plans, drawings,
&amp;c ., with his public and private papers, were lost,
except a note or two that were, just a few days
before we left Cabul, put with my Journal. I
believe several people kept an account of these
proceedings, but all except myself lost all they
had written; and had recourse to memory afterwards.
I lost every thing except the clothes I
wore; and therefore it may appear strange that I
should have saved these papers. The mystery is,
however, easily solved. After every thing was
packed on the night before we left Cabul, I sat
up to add a few lines to the events of the day,
and the next morning I put them in a small bag
and tied them round my waist. I am indebted to
Capt. Souter, of H. M. 44th Regiment, for a plan,
from recollection, of the cantonment and forts.
The inaccuracies, if any, are but trifling; and it is
sufficiently clear to indicate the positions of the
principal places alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
A much better narrative of past events might
have been written, even by myself; but I have
preferred keeping my Journal as originally written,
when events were fresh, and men's minds were
biassed by the reports of the day, and even hour.</p>

<p>It is easy to argue on the wisdom or folly
of conduct after the catastrophe has taken place.
With regard therefore to our chiefs, I shall only
say that the Envoy has deeply paid for his attempt
to out diplomatize the Affghans. Gen. Elphinstone,
conscious that his powers of mind had become
enfeebled with those of his body, finding there
was no hope of Gen. Nott's arrival to assume the
command, called in another officer to his aid,
who had but one object in view (to get back, at
all hazards, to Hindostan). He averred that a retreat
to the Bala Hissar was impossible, as we
should have to fight our way (for one mile and a
half)! If we could not accomplish that, how were
we to get through a week's march to Jellalabad?
Once in the Bala Hissar, which would have been
easily defended by one thousand men, we should
have had plenty of troops for foraging purposes;
and the village of Ben-i-shehr, just under the Bala
Hissar, would have given us a twelvemonth's provisions
if we had only made the demonstration of a
night march, to have the appearance of taking them
by force. Sallies from thence might also have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
made into the town, where there was always a
party, particularly the Kuzzilbashes, who would
have covertly assisted us, until our returning
fortunes permitted them to do so openly.</p>

<p>Independent of &mdash;&mdash;'s determination to return
to India, he often refused to give any
opinion when asked for it by the General, a
cautious measure whereby he probably hoped to
escape the obloquy that he expected would attach
to the council of war, composed of Gen. Elphinstone,
Brig. Shelton, Brig. Anquetil, and Col.
Chambers. I might say nominally composed; numerically
it was much more extended. Capt.
Grant, with cold caution, obstructed every enterprise,
and threw all possible difficulties in the way;
Capt. Bellew was full of doubts and suggestions,
all tending to hamper and retard operations; and
numbers of young men gave much gratuitous
advice; in fact, the greater part of the night was
spent in confusing the General's ideas, instead of
allowing a sick man time by rest to invigorate his
powers. Brig. Shelton was in the habit of taking
his rezai with him, and lying on the floor during
these discussions, when sleep, whether real or
feigned, was a resource against replying to disagreeable
questions. Major Thain, a sincere friend
and good adviser of the General's, withdrew in
disgust from the council: and Sturt, who was ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
ready to do any thing or give his opinion when
asked, from the same feeling no longer proffered it.</p>

<p>As a proof that Sir William Macnaghten's
confidence in Shah Shoojah was latterly much
shaken, he wrote to the Governor of India, proposing
that, if it really should be proved that
His Majesty was acting treacherously against us,
the Dost should be restored to his country. But
it is very doubtful whether this despatch ever
reached the Governor-General.</p>

<p>I shall not refer back to many small insurrections
that took place, but only allude to the events
that immediately preceded the grand insurrection
at Cabul.</p>

<p>I believe I have indifferently written the name
of a village as Dehmaru and Behmaru; it is called
both, but Behmaru is the correct name, signifying
the husbandless: Dehmaru would be the Husband's
Village. It takes its name from a romantic legend
of a girl of rank betrothed to a chief who was
said to have been slain in combat, and she consequently
pined away and died also; but the lover
recovered from his wounds, and placed a stone,
said to be one of those white ones that look like
women in Bourkhor, over her grave on the Behmaru
hill; and when he died he was buried beside
her, with a similar stone to mark the spot.</p>

<h3>CABUL.</h3>

<p><i>September, 1841.</i>&mdash;Sir William Macnaghten obtained
a force to be sent out to the Zoormut country.
A chief, contemptuously designated as a robber,
was said to have gone into the town of Zaho beyond
Gurdez. The information given to Capt. Hay, commanding
one of the Shah's corps, represented the
place as contemptible. He went there with some
few troops supported by guns, found that the place
was much stronger than he had supposed, and
that he could not do any thing against it, and that
he was fired at from six forts. On this intelligence
reaching Cabul, a large force was sent out on the
28th of September, under Col. Oliver of the 5th,
consisting of half of Capt. Abbott's battery, two
iron nine-pounder guns, a wing of the 44th Queen's,
the 5th N. I., Capt. Warburton's guns, Capt.
Backhouse's mountain train, Anderson's horse,
the Kohistan corps, and two others of the Shah's,
with the King's sappers and miners and the Hindostanee
sappers and miners under Capt. Sturt, as
sole engineer.</p>

<p>The first day's march was through the city, with
narrow streets and sharp turnings, very unfavorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
for guns, as was also a bad road afterwards,
a nullah, and a steep ascent; all which circumstances
kept them from getting into camp until
late in the evening; after that the road was good,
with the exception of the Al-Timor pass, which
was very steep. It rises 9600 feet above the level
of the sea. The crest was represented as being as
much as a man on horseback could surmount, and
the artillery would never have been got over it had
not the natives given their assistance: 800 of them
dragged the guns up. The great difficulty (as far as
I could learn) lay, not so much in the acclivity, as
in the roughness of the road, which was perfectly
filled with huge blocks of stone. Here it was
dreadfully cold, and snow fell. Beyond this pass
the people of the country fled, abandoning their
property, and consequently their suffering must
be very great in the approaching winter.</p>

<p>The chiefs declared that they were ready to submit,
but the orders were peremptory to destroy
the forts that had fired on the Shah's troops.
Lieut. John Conolly and Lieut. Burnet (54th) chupao'd<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
Akram Khan, riding sixty miles at night
with 300 horsemen. They surprised the chief, his
wives, and families; it was however done through
the treachery of the chief's son-in-law, who disclosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
his retreat. The Shah has ordered Akram
Khan's execution. Whilst these events were going
on, disturbances had broken out near Cabul, where
much had occurred to incite the chiefs to rise. In
former times, under the feudal system, when the sovereign
of Cabul required troops, each bold chieftain
came forward with his retainers; but these vassals
had been taken from them, and were embodied
in corps commanded by British officers, to whom
they owed no affection, and only paid a forced
obedience, whilst their hearts were with their national
religion; their chief's power was now greatly
limited, and the chouk guaranteed to them was
withheld on the plea that the Company had commanded
retrenchments. But the saving required
by Government was a curtailment of those expences
which were defrayed by its own rupees, whereas
the 40,000 rupees now the subject of dispute were,
in fact, no saving at all to us, as that money was
never paid by the Company, but was the chouk
or money excused to the chiefs out of the revenue
or dues owing to the King, on condition of their
enforcing the submission of the petty chiefs and
the payment of their rents. This sum whether paid
to Shah Shoojah or not, would never have replenished
the Hon. Company's coffers; and by upholding
the Shah in such an act of aggression we
compromised our faith, and caused a pretty general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
insurrection, said to be headed by Meer
Musjude.</p>

<p>The Kohistanee chiefs are urged on by the
Dooranee Chiefs in Cabul, and all the country
about Tézeen and Bhoodkhak is in a state of revolt.
It is only wonderful this did not take place sooner.</p>

<p>The Indian government have for some time
been constantly writing regarding the enormous
expenditure in Affghanistan, every d&#257;k has reiterated
retrench; but instead of lessening the political
expences and making deductions in that department,
they commenced by cutting off these 40,000
rupees from the chiefs.</p>

<p>Affairs having assumed this gloomy appearance,
the Envoy sent in all haste for the force under
Col. Oliver to return as quickly as possible,
leaving it to Capt. Macgregor's diplomatic ability
to patch up the Zaho business as best he might, and
come to the rescue with his advice regarding the
Tézeenites, with whose customs, &amp;c . he had much
familiarity. Macgregor strongly advised the not
stirring up a hornet's nest, and wished to try what
he could do by diplomacy. Valour, however, was
the order of the day; and various were the suggestions
of the politicals. One plan was, that Gen.
Sale's brigade, on its way down to the provinces,
should make a detour viâ Nigerow. The troops
were not to fight but only by their presence to overawe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
the Nigerowians, whilst some neighbouring
tribes, who had a blood feud with them, should
make the attack. Plans of the country were sent
in, with imaginary roads drawn on them from
various points, whilst supervening obstacles to the
march of an army, such as hills and passes, were
omitted. The scheme was not considered feasible,
in consequence of the advanced state of the season,
it being now October, and from the apprehension
that the cold would destroy the camels requisite
to carry the tents and provisions.</p>

<p><i>9th October.</i>&mdash;The 35th N. I., commanded by
Col. Monteath, C. B., with two six-pounder guns
under Lieut. Dawes, were suddenly sent at a
day's notice to Bhoodkhak, partly as being the
first march towards the provinces (they forming a
part of Sale's, or the 1st brigade), and partly in
consequence of the disturbances.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;The 13th light infantry, commanded by
Lieut.-Col. Dennie, C. B., were also sent at a few
hours' notice to Bhoodkhak; but as they were not
to proceed on their march until the arrival of
Capt. Abbott with his guns, I remained at Cabul
with my daughter, Mrs. Sturt, who had been
staying with us during her husband's absence
with Col. Oliver's force; and Sale took his departure
from Cabul, fully expecting me to follow
him in three days at the latest.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;The 13th and 35th, with the two guns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
under Dawes, moved forward, the whole under
Sale, them object being to go through the Khoord
Cabul pass, and place the 35th N. I. in an advanced
position at Khoord Cabul, after which the
13th were to fall back again on Bhoodkhak.
This movement was effected, but with considerable
loss. The Khoord Cabul is a narrow defile,
enclosed by high and rugged rocks; it is said
that the number of the enemy did not exceed 60
men, but they possessed considerable advantage
over our troops in their knowledge of the country
and in the positions they took up; for until they
commenced firing, not a man was known to be
there. They were concealed behind rocks and
stones, and by a stone breastwork that they
had hastily thrown up, behind which, on our
troops entering the pass, they laid in wait, and
appeared to pick off the officers in particular.
The number of the enemy were, however, underrated,
as I am assured there were fully 200 of
them. The 35th lost, in killed and wounded,
about 40 men; and Capt. Younghusband, of the
same corps, was badly wounded in the foot. The
13th had 8 men killed and 19 wounded. Gen.
Sale was wounded in the left leg; the ball
entered near the ankle, shivered the small bone,
and was taken out from the skin on the other
side where it had lodged. Lieut. Mein of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
13th, while leading his company up to the breastwork,
was severely and dangerously wounded in
the head; the skull was fractured by the ball,
which entered it. Lieut. Oakes, of the same
regiment, had also a very narrow escape, being
wounded in the head also. It rained very heavily
that night, and the 13th had the full benefit of it,
for they were out all night, having two alertes;
one of the sentries was mortally wounded, being
shot on his post. Exertions were made to discover
the persons who fired on our sentries:
three men were seized who had in their possession
the soldier's belt, which was a tolerable
evidence of criminality; but the Envoy wrote to
say, that the people about the King said that those
men were good men and true, and they were to
be released without any punishment!</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Two companies of the 37th N. I. and
two guns under Mr. Waller, were sent to reinforce
the 13th at Bhoodkhak, leaving only the remainder
of the 37th in cantonments, and no guns.
Should there be a rising in Cabul, we should be
entirely without the means of defence. The
Shah's troops have moved from their camp behind,
to Siah Sung, for protection, as, from the force
which has gone with Col. Oliver, they have not
guards enough to protect their camp, or the stores
left there: their sentries are fired on constantly.
Lieut. Mayne, of the Shah's service was reported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
to have been shot when going his rounds last night,
but it was a mistake; the suwar who accompanied
him was the sufferer.</p>

<p>A poor woman, a Mrs. Smith, the wife of a
conductor, was travelling up the Bolan pass to
Kandahar, with a few suwars as a guard. She
was attacked by the Belooches; the suwars fled,
Mrs. Smith got out of her palkee and ran a short
distance, but was soon overtaken and killed; the
body was not plundered, and her rings were
found on her fingers, and her earrings in her ears;
not that they committed the act from hatred to
the Feringhees and disdain of plunder, but that,
according to the superstition of these tribes, it is
a most unlucky circumstance to kill a woman;
and finding their victim of the gentle sex, they
fled, and left her as she fell.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Col. Oliver's force returned; Capt. Abbott's
guns have had their carriages much damaged;
the spokes of sundry wheels are absent,
thanks to the acclivities and declivities of the Al-Timor
pass, so that he requires a few days to put
all to rights before he can go to join Sale with the
37th: when they do so, the brigade will move on
Tézeen.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;The enemy came down (a chupao or
night attack), 400 strong, on Khoord Cabul,
where an action was fought with great loss on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
both sides; Lieut. Jenkins of the 30th was mortally
wounded, and lingered in great agony,
having been shot through the spine. Col. Monteath
sent to Sale for reinforcements, who despatched
to him the two companies of the 37th
that had lately arrived at Bhoodkhak.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;The remainder of the 37th marched from
Cabul to Bhoodkhak; also Capt. Abbott and his
guns, and the Shah's sappers and miners under
Capt. Broadfoot. Sale and Sturt have agreed
that I am to remain with him and my daughter
at Cabul, and to come on with the Envoy, who
is anxious to go to his government at Bombay,
and Gen. Elphinstone, who returns to the provinces
in consequence of ill health.</p>

<p>Sale's brigade is to move on to Khoord Cabul
to-morrow. Seventy-seven of the wounded men
from thence and Bhoodkhak have come in to
cantonments, as also Lieut. Mein, of the 13th.
It appears that the Hazir Bash, the escort sent
by the King with Capt. Trevor to Capt. Macgregor
(political agent), were the people who let
the Ghilzyes into the 35th's camp; they were
partly of the same tribe, and whilst the rest were
fighting, these ever-ready gentlemen did a little
work of their own, cutting down surwans and
hamstringing camels. Whilst they were thus employed
Capt. Wyndham came up with a company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
of the 35th, and fired into the midst, putting them
to rout. Col. Monteath turned these people out
of his camp as unsafe to be trusted; the Envoy
has ordered them to be sent back to Cabul, and
to be kindly treated, and will not believe them to
be in fault. The Hazir Bash, as their name imports,
are "aye ready for the field," but I fear
that just now&mdash;</p>

<div class="misc">

<ul>
 <li>"At a word it may be understood,</li>
 <li>&nbsp;They are ready for evil and not for good,"</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p class="nodent">like Walter Scott's goblin page.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Lieut. Jenkins's body was brought to
Capt. Sturt's house; he died just after he was
placed in the dhooley, and was thus saved the additional
pain of the journey.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Lieut. Jenkins's funeral took place. As
the 35th lost ninety camels, and fifty more were
sent in with the sick and wounded, the force is
detained until more camels can reach them from
Cabul.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;Much firing has been heard, and great
anxiety prevails. All the forts about Cabul are
empty, and the Juwans have gone (it is said) to aid
in the fight against us at Tézeen: Sale writes that
the report is, that the people at Tézeen say
they are unable to cope with us in battle, but that
they intend to plunder and annoy the force on its
way down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
<i>24th.</i>&mdash;Sturt sent me a note before I was dressed
this morning to inform me, that at Tézeen one
small fort had been evacuated, and that Lieut. E.
King, of the 13th light infantry, was killed. In
the course of the morning I heard that the 13th,
having expended their ammunition, were obliged
to retreat; that poor King, being the last man to
do so, was shot dead on the spot. The men could
not stop to take up his body then, but they returned
shortly after, and obtained it before the
enemy had time to do more than take off his
jacket. He was a gallant high-spirited young man,
universally beloved, and consequently is much
lamented. He was interred under a tent at night,
lest the Affghans should recognise the grave and
disinter the body. We afterwards were informed
that the attack was made on the rear guard before
they quitted their ground; that the enemy cut in,
in rear of the baggage, took ninety camels with
all the treasure of the 13th, a large quantity of
ammunition, and other stores.</p>

<p>Gen. Elphinstone told me, that Sale had been
very imprudent in using his leg, and had consequently
been suffering a great deal of pain, but
that the remedies applied had given him relief;
he expressed great regret that he had not communicated
any information to me, taking it for
granted that the Envoy had done so, if I had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
a letter from Sale himself; but he was wounded,
and with plenty of military occupation, could not
always find time to write me many particulars, as
he had to send his despatches off as quickly as
possible to the General.</p>

<p>A letter from a friend with the force that was
sent from Kandahar mentions, that the force had
arrived at the extreme point of their tour (Dehwarah)
on the 15th of October, and that they were to
set out on their return the following day. Capt.
Leeson, of the 42d, in temporary command of the
Shah's 1st cavalry regiment, was to march twenty-five
miles and over a pass (the Kotilla Meercha),
to be out of the way of the others, on account of
the scarcity of water. The troops had not had
any thing to do, nor was there even a chance of
their having a foe to contend with, for the people
of that part of the country got such a lesson in
the fight of Secunderabad, that the chiefs could
not have collected 200 men; the forts were mere
shells, their walls of no thickness.</p>

<p>The fort against which the eighteen-pounder
guns were sent out, has been an utter ruin for
years, not only indefensible but uninhabitable.
The troops have been terribly distressed bringing
the guns over and through the passes, which are
more difficult than can be imagined by those that
have not seen them; the last, the Dana Thunghee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
is described as resembling what the Khyber
would be about Ali Musjid, if it had a deep and
very rapid river flowing through it, the said river
having to be crossed thirteen times.</p>

<p>The Kotilla Taj-i (crown of the mountains), is
very steep, and as nearly impracticable as it can be,
without being actually so. To avoid these passes,
the troops are to go through the Kotilla Murdee
(dead men's pass), which Capt. Leeson reports, from
what he has seen of it, as practicable but difficult.
He writes to me that it will take a great deal of
labour to get the guns over it. From thence they
steer for Kurtoot (the donkey's mulberry), but it
was not known whether the route by that place
was practicable; if not, they must face the Kotilla
Taj-i, bad as it is. Major Rawlinson, the political
agent, had obtained the blessings of the force for
leading them such a wild-goose chase; he seems
to have received information that Akram Khan
had a fort there, but not to have known what
that fort was like. It is a pity the army were
harassed unnecessarily; but in Major R.'s defence
it is but justice to say, that information is difficult
to procure, and that it all comes from our enemies.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;I received a letter from Sale, in which he
informs me, that the conduct of the troops employed
in the affair at Tézeen was good beyond
all praise; but, concluding that I had heard all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
particulars, he did not enter into detail. He wrote
me that he was to halt that day (the 24th), as
Macgregor was in treaty with the chiefs, who he
says are willing to refrain from all further opposition,
and say they are convinced they have
no chance against us. Sturt has seen a letter
from Lieut. Cunningham, of the Shah's sappers
and miners, by which it appears that no enemy
showing themselves, Capt. Paton, Qr.-Mr.-Genl.,
was on the point of pitching the camp, when
some of the advance guard were fired on, upon
which two companies were sent from each corps,
with the sappers, who all behaved gallantly; they
went up the hills, and down again, chased the
enemy into their fort, and the sappers, commanded
by Capt. Broadfoot, drove them through it, and
followed them through the wicket they escaped
by. The 13th having expended their ammunition
were obliged to retreat, and it was then that
Lieut. E. King fell.</p>

<p>Lady Macnaghten called on me, and told me that
Capt. Macgregor, Political Agent, wrote that the
chiefs received him with great politeness, and
were pleased at the confidence reposed in them by
his going to meet them attended only by one
suwar. They appeared to be unanimous, and
many in number, mustering 700 followers, who
were daily increasing. They agreed to all the conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
but one; whatever that is, it appears to be
the main point to be conceded, and we suppose
that it relates to the 40,000 rupees. One day has
been allowed to the chiefs to deliberate. The
Envoy was some time since warned by three
Affghans not to ride so early in the morning or
so late in the evening as was his wont; but,
whether from policy or natural fearlessness, he
has not attended to their advice. The Akhoonzadah
has also told him that three men have
sworn on the Koran to take his life. The people
of Tagow and Lughman are leagued with those
of Tézeen. Capt. Macgregor writes that a great
quantity of ammunition was left on the road for
want of camels to carry it on, which must have
proved a great prize to the enemy, who were
much in want of it.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;There being a report that all was peaceably
settled at Tézeen, I became very anxious
for intelligence. Two letters were brought to me,
but alas! neither of them were to my address, one
being from Capt. Havelock to Gen. Elphinstone,
the other from Capt. Paton to Major Thain.
After giving them a reasonable time to ruminate
over their news, I wrote to Major Thain, requesting
him to give me any information in his
power; and informing him that I had no letter, I
got the provoking reply that the Sahib was gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
out. Sometime afterwards Major Thain called:
he owned he was puzzled as to what was going
on, but hoped that affairs would remain quiet
until we got out of the country. He said it was
the present intention, that the sick should move
out on Saturday next, and the Envoy and the
General should leave Cabul on Monday the 1st.
Shortly after he left me, he sent me the two
letters to read; he had expressed his surprise that
they had not arrived sooner, both being dated the
24th; and my letter of the same date from Sale
had arrived the day before! Capt. Havelock
mentions that all is settled and hostages given,
but remarks that, since the pacification, the camels
have been fired on, as also our outposts, but
says, the one may be attributable to the arrival of
a chief who was in ignorance of the treaty, and
the other, to their people not being well in hand, a
pretty sounding phrase; but are we to understand
that our men are so well in hand as not to resent it?
Capt. Paton writes mysteriously, that he has much
to communicate, "better spoken than written,"
and says the enemy have consented regarding the
obnoxious chief, (some person who they did not
wish should participate in the benefits of the treaty).
He adds that a force to be of any use in that
country must not be hampered with camels, tents
or baggage, and that the ammunition should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
carried only on mules or yaboos. If all remained
quiet, Paton and Havelock were to return, and the
force to go on to Kutta Lung. Paton hints that
something had gone wrong which would not have
done so, had Gen. Sale not been confined to his
dhooley. Thain tells me that there is no mention in
Sale's despatch of the gallant conduct of the sappers
and miners as related by Cunningham; he being
wounded probably did not observe all that passed,
and did not have the circumstances brought to his
notice in time to write them; but had he done so, it
would have been very immaterial, for, excepting
from private letters, no intelligence transpires.</p>

<p>Last year, when Sir Willoughby Cotton commanded,
and during the disturbances in the Kohistan,
every despatch from Sale, who commanded
the troops there, was promulgated in orders, and
the present system of keeping information close
is disgusting; there can be no secrets regarding
what passes in action in the field. The general
impression is that the Envoy is trying to deceive
himself into an assurance that the country is in a
quiescent state. He has a difficult part to play,
without sufficient moral courage to stem the
current singly. About two months since Sir
William wrote to Lord Auckland, explaining to him
the present state of Affghanistan, and requesting
that five additional regiments should be sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
this country, two of them to be European. To
these statements a written war succeeded between
the Envoy and the Supreme Government
of Bengal. Letter after letter came calling for
retrenchment. Sir William had been appointed
from home Governor of Bombay, and was particularly
chosen for the office from his being a
moderator and a man unlikely to push any violent
measures; he hoped affairs might take a turn for the
better, and was evidently anxious to leave Cabul
and assume his new appointment. In an evil hour
he acceded to the entreaties of Sir Alexander
Burnes (who appears to have been blinded on
the subject) and wrote to Lord Auckland to
nullify his former request for additional troops,
and to say that part of those now in the country
might be withdrawn. The 1st brigade under
Sale was accordingly ordered to be in readiness to
move down; and it was generally understood, that
all would be withdrawn as soon as the Shah had
raised five more regiments of his own. The
letter of recall, as we may term Sir William's, was
sent off only two days before the breaking out of
the Zoormut affair.</p>

<p>Great stress has been laid upon the chiefs
having given us hostages, but this is no certain
proof of their sincerity; we have been long
enough amongst them for them to know the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
British character; they also know that the Dost's
family were safely and honourably treated under
our protection, whilst he and his son were in
arms against us, and they naturally consider their
safety as a proof of that of any hostages they
leave with us.</p>

<p>The d&#257;ks, which have not arrived since the
2d (nor have been despatched since the 4th), are
confidently asserted to be now on their way, and
are expected in to-morrow at the farthest. No
one appears to have been made acquainted with
the terms of the treaty, which have been kept
close by the Envoy, who, however, observed that
Macgregor had given them better terms than he
himself would have done. They are to get the
40,000 rupees the quarrel began about, and they
promise to return us any property they can find of
ours: so that we leave off where we set out,
barring our killed and wounded, expence, loss
of ammunition and baggage, and annoyance of
the detention, if not loss, of our dâks, bhanghys,
&amp;c .</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;I hear that Macgregor writes to the Envoy
that the country about Tézeen never was in so
tranquil a state as it is at present! Now, with a
little variation in the wording, he might have
cautiously written to the Envoy, so as to be understood
by him alone, and have intimated that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
country was now as quiet as it ever was; which, to
those who know the wild tribes thereabouts located,
indicates any thing but a state of pacification.</p>

<p>The sick are again ordered to be off to-morrow,
with a wing of the 54th, to Tézeen, where the
37th awaits their arrival; and at present it is
supposed that the Envoy and General will follow
on the 1st.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Sale has written me that he arrived at
Seh Baba on the 26th at 1 <small>P.M.</small>; that the rear
guard was fired on a mile from camp, and three
men wounded. They were in a snug post for
the night. His leg was doing well, and all inflammation
had subsided. They had grain and
bhoosa in plenty. Capt. Grant tells me that a
chief goes on daily in advance, to keep the
country quiet, and bring in grain.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;We hear that since the force left Khoord
Cabul, they have never pitched a tent. The
rear guard has been attacked daily, and the
bivouack fired on every night. The camels are
dying forty of a night from cold and starvation.
Lieut. Jennings (13th) has been wounded severely
in the arm, the bone broken, and the ball went
through into his side. Lieut. Rattray (13th)
wounded, and a sergeant killed and 3 men
wounded; 4 or 5 Sipahees<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
of the 35th wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
<i>30th.</i>&mdash;A small dâk has come in for the Envoy
and General only, and that only newspapers; the
Envoy sent orders to have the dâk sent by a
private path, which succeeded.</p>

<p>It seems that the terms made with the chiefs of
Tézeen were, the remission of the money which gave
rise to the dispute. They were required to call
out the <i>Ooloos</i>, which they represented would be
attended with considerable expense, so they received
10,000 rupees to enable them to do so,
when they pocketed the money, but omitted calling
out the militia! Macgregor writes that he suspects
the chiefs are at the bottom of all the plundering
and attacks on our force, though they profess to
have nothing to do with it, and that the depredators
are the robber-tribes.</p>

<p>Last night as the cavalry videttes went their
rounds at Siah Sung, a party of men rushed out
of a cave and fired at them; some were taken prisoners;
part of them were Affghans, but four
were Hindostanees, and one of them was a Chuprassy
of Capt. Bygrave, who endeavoured to excuse
himself by saying, he fired at the party supposing
them to be Affghans, but could give no reason
for being there himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Melville was attacked last evening, but set
spurs to his horse and galloped off, on which the
Affghans set up a shout; this is the fourth attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
on the part of the Affghans to assassinate
British officers within a short time. I before
mentioned Mr. Mayne's escape; Dr. Metcalfe was
also nearly cut down; and Lieut. Waller, of the
Artillery, was wounded on the head whilst riding
close to the Siah Sung camp.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;The invalids, whose march had been
countermanded, are again under Orders to go out
to Siah Sung on Tuesday, to be in readiness to
march on Wednesday the 3d of next month.
When the barracks for the men and the officers'
quarters were erected in the Cabul cantonment,
a committee assembled to value them and fix the
house rent, both for them and for the two houses
to be occupied by the Commander of the forces
and the second in command. It was fixed at ten
per cent. on the actual outlay as specified by the
engineers' department. We paid ours monthly,
as did the 13th, through the regimental paymaster.
The 35th also paid their rent monthly. There
was some dispute regarding it with some others,
in consequence of the rooms not being all quite
finished; but as Capt. Sturt was not ordered to
collect the money, but only to pay over whatever
he received, the business remained in abeyance.
An inquiry is now making about the house rent
that has not been paid by the officers who have
gone away, so I feel quite delighted that Sale and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
I are out of the scrape. Brig. Shelton has written
officially to the General, to say that it is very
hard that he is kept at Siah Sung, when there is a
good house in cantonments to which he has a right,
and applies officially to the General to give him
up either his own house or ours. Now, as long as
Brig. Shelton's duty keeps him at Siah Sung, he has
no business in cantonments. This is Sunday: both
the General and I expect to march on Wednesday,
so, <i>par complaisance</i>, we neither of us expected
to be turned out; however, if we do not go,
we both intend vacating our habitations, when
our house will be made over to Capt. Sturt, to
undergo repairs, so as to be ready for the reception
of the next Commander of the forces. Gen. Nott
has been written to, to come up immediately, and
Gen. Elphinstone is to give up the command to
him from the 1st of Nov. The reason that our
house is in future to be appropriated by the
chief arises from its being the best and most
commodious. Sir Willoughby Cotton gave his
plan, and Sale his, when the houses were built;
and Sir Willoughby living <i>en garçon</i> had omitted
many little comforts that we had considered indispensable.
Added to which, Sale had a <i>shoke</i>
for gardening, and had an excellent kitchen-garden;
whilst I cultivated flowers that were the
admiration of the Affghan gentlemen who came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
to see us. My sweet peas and geraniums were
much admired, but they were all eager to obtain
the seed of the edible pea, which flourished well;
and by being sown as soon as the frost was over
we had plenty of succession crops, and we still
have peas growing which we hope, if not cut off
by frost, will give a crop next month.</p>

<p>The potatoes thrive well, and will be a very
valuable addition to the <i>cuisine</i>. The cauliflowers,
artichokes, and turnip radishes are very fine, and
peculiarly mild in their flavour; they are all from
seed we brought with us from our garden at Kurnaul.
The Cabul lettuces are hairy and inferior
to those cultivated by us; but the Cabul cabbages
are superior, being milder, and the red cabbage
from English seed grows well.</p>

<p>Regarding the fruits of Affghanistan, I should
not be believed were I to state the truth. Selected
grapes off a bunch of those in the
Kohistan have been known to weigh 200 grains;
the largest I ever weighed myself was 127 grains.
It was the kind denominated the Bull's Eye
by the English; I believe the natives call it
the Hoosseinee-Angoor; its form is nearly round,
and the taste very luscious; it is of a kind
not generally purchaseable. At Kardunah they
grow in great perfection. Those I ate were
sent as a present from a native gentleman to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
Captain Sturt, as were also some very delicious
pears from Turkistan. The largest peaches I
have myself weighed turned the scale at fifteen
rupees, and were fully equal in juiciness and
flavour to those of the English hothouse. The
finest sort are in the Kohistan, but are so delicate
they will not bear carriage to Cabul. I have
been assured by my friends who have been there
in the peach season that the best fruit of the kind
at my table was quite inferior to those above
mentioned. The Orleans blue plum is excellent.
There is a green one resembling in appearance a
greengage, but very tasteless. There are also
many other kinds, with a great variety of melons,
Water, Musk, and Surda, which is accounted the
best.</p>

<p>It is reported that Sale's brigade are very badly
off for carriage and provisions, and we have here
no camels to send to them. The 37th N. I. and
the Shah's sappers and miners are ordered back
to the Huft Kotul, to await the arrival of the
invalids at that place. It is now said that, from
the difficulty experienced in procuring carriage,
the sick and wounded must be left here.</p>

<p>In the evening we heard that the Envoy had
received a hurried note from Capt. Macgregor, by
which it appears that between Jugdaluk and
Soorkhab the troops were attacked by about 400
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
men; that ours were unable to force the hills. The
enemy left the pass open, by which the brigade
proceeded; but they came down in force on the
rear-guard, who are stated to have been panic-struck.
Our loss is stated at ninety killed and
wounded. Capt. Wyndham of the 35th killed,
and Lieut. Coombes severely wounded; Lieuts.
Rattray and Halcombe of the 13th Light Infantry
wounded. There has been great loss of baggage
and camels; seventy of the latter carried off, which
were returned to us on paying ten rupees each
for the Hindostanees, and twenty each for the
Affghan animals. This is instituting a premium
for plunder, but it was caused by dire necessity.</p>

<p>There were no despatches for the General, nor
letters for me, but we hope to receive further
accounts to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>1st November.</i>&mdash;No letters from camp, which
has caused both surprise and anxiety.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;Last night a party of Kohistanees entered
the city; a large body of horsemen were also seen
proceeding towards the city from the road that
leads by the Shah's camp behind Siah Sung.</p>

<p>This morning, early, all was in commotion in
Cabul; the shops were plundered, and the people
were all fighting.</p>

<p>Our Affghan servant, Mahomed Ali, who used
to sleep in the city, when he passed out to come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
to my house in the morning was threatened, and
reviled as the chuprassy of the Feringhee General,
who, they asserted, had been beaten at Tézeen,
and that all his troops had run away, and he with
them!</p>

<p>The Shah resides in the Bala Hissar, and his
guns from that fortress were constantly firing; the
Affghans in the city were doing the same from six
in the morning. Capt. Sturt hearing that Capt.
Johnson's (paymaster to the Shah's force) house
and treasury in the city were attacked, as also Sir
Alexander Burnes's, went to Gen. Elphinstone,
who sent him with an important message, first
to Brig. Shelton at Siah Sung, and afterwards to
the King to concert with him measures for the
defence of that fortress. Just as he entered the
precincts of the palace, he was stabbed in three
places by a young man well dressed, who escaped
into a building close by, where he was protected
by the gates being shut. Fortunately for my son-in-law,
Capt. Lawrence had been sent to the King
by the Envoy, and he kindly procured a palkee,
and sent Sturt home with a strong guard of fifty
lancers, but they were obliged to make a long
detour by Siah Sung. In the mean time,
Lawrence came to tell me all that had passed, and
to break the bad news to my daughter, Mrs.
Sturt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Lawrence (military secretary to the Envoy) had
had a very narrow escape himself. An Affghan,
grinding his teeth, and grinning with rage and
hatred of the Feringhees, aimed a blow at him
with a sword, which Lawrence parried, and
putting spurs to his horse he escaped: one of his
suwars received a cut in the leg, which was revenged
by another horseman shooting the fellow.</p>

<p>It was Lawrence who came to tell me of Sale's
wound; he is always kind and friendly, though he
has now been twice the herald of ill news. It
struck me as probable that the suwars would
take Sturt to his own house; and as he and my
daughter were staying with me, there would not
even be a bed to place him on there. I therefore
determined not to lose time by waiting till the
bearers could get my palkee ready, but took my
chuttah and walked off as fast as I could towards
Sturt's house. I fortunately met Major Thain
(aide-de-camp to Gen. Elphinstone), for I soon saw
a crowd of about fifty suwars in his compound.
Thain ran on, and told the bearers to bring him
on to my house. I cannot describe how shocked
I felt when I saw poor Sturt; for Lawrence,
fearing to alarm us, had said he was only slightly
wounded. He had been stabbed deeply in the
shoulder and side, and on the face (the latter
wound striking on the bone just missed the temple):
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
he was covered with blood issuing from his mouth,
and was unable to articulate. From the wounds
in the face and shoulder, the nerves were affected;
the mouth would not open, the tongue was
swollen and paralysed, and he was ghastly and
faint from loss of blood. He could not lie
down, from the blood choking him; and had to
sit up in the palkee as best he might, without
a pillow to lean against. With some difficulty
and great pain he was supported up stairs, and
laid on his bed, when Dr. Harcourt dressed his
wounds, which having been inflicted about ten
o'clock, now at one were cold and stiff with
clotted blood. The tongue was paralysed, and
the nerves of the throat affected, so that he could
neither swallow nor articulate; and the choking
sensation of the blood in his throat was most
painful to witness. He was better towards
evening; and by his wife's unremitting attention
in assisting him to get rid of the clotted blood
from his mouth by incessant applications of warm
wet cloths, he was by eleven at night able to utter
a tolerably articulate sound. With what joy did
we hear him faintly utter <i>bet-ter</i>; and he really
seemed to enjoy a tea-spoonful of water, which we
got into his mouth by a drop or two at a time,
painful as it was to him to swallow it.</p>

<p>It was most gratifying to see the attention and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
kind feeling manifested on the occasion by the
sergeants of the engineer department, and their
anxiety (particularly Sergeant Deane's) to make
themselves useful to Sturt.</p>

<p>Capt. Warburton, Capt. Johnson, and Capt.
Troup were all fortunately in cantonments; for
their houses in the city were plundered and
burnt. At Johnson's (the King's treasury) the
guard of forty men was massacred, as also all his
servants but one, who luckily was not at home.
The insurgents looted a lakh and 70,000 rupees
of public property, and Johnson lost above 10,000
rupees of his own property.</p>

<p>There were of course various reports. We
first heard that, on the affair breaking out, Sir A.
Burnes went over to the Wuzeer's to ascertain what
could be done; and that he was safe there, excepting
having been shot in the leg. The King, from
the Bala Hissar, sent intelligence to the Envoy
"that Burnes was all right;" but a few hours
afterwards the King acknowledged that he did not
know any thing of him, neither did the Envoy at
seven in the evening, when Capt. Lawrence and
Capt. John Conolly came to inquire after Sturt's
health. Our only hopes of Burnes' safety rest on
the possibility of his having obtained refuge in
some harem. His brother's fate is as yet unknown.
Capt. Broadfoot was shot in the breast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
and killed. He was breakfasting with the two
Burnes's: before he fell he had killed six men with
his own hand. Capt. Drummond is protected by
Osmar Khan, Kariez-i-Umeer, chief of a domain,
the first stage from Cabul towards the Kohistan.
Capt. Mackenzie, political assistant to Capt. Mackeson
at Peshawur, came up to Cabul some time
since; and when Lieut. Milne (in the Commissariat)
was sent to Khelat-i-Gilzie, Mackenzie took his
place in the Shah's commissariat. He was located in
a fort divided into two by the range of Commissariat
Godowns,&mdash;one side inhabited by Brig. Anquetil,
commanding the Shah's forces, the other
by Mackenzie, who (the Brigadier being in cantonments)
held out in both, with some sappers
and miners, a few of the Shah's 6th Regt., and 130
Juzailchees: the latter are good men, and mostly
Usufzyes. In this fort were stored 8000 maunds
of ottah and wheat. Capt. Trevor hopes to defend
his tower as long as it is not fired. Another report
states that Trevor, his wife, and one child, have
escaped, whilst his six other children have been
murdered. Another, that he has escaped, but
that his wife and seven children are all murdered.</p>

<p>The Kuzzilbash quarter of the city is said to
be all quiet. Naïb Shureef's son has been killed
in some of the scuffles in the city. Abdoollah
Khan, Amenoollah Khan, and a few other Dooranee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
chiefs, are said to be the instigators of the
insurrection.</p>

<p>The King (who resides in the Bala Hissar) says
if the rebellion is not all over to-morrow morning,
he will burn the city,&mdash;by no means an easy task:
the houses are all flat-roofed and mud-roofed. It
is true Cabul has been burnt three times before,
and therefore what has been may occur again.
By throwing shells into the houses you may fire
them; and the individual house fired, being ceiled
with wood, blazes fiercely until the roof falls in,
and the mud and dust smother the fire without
danger to the adjacent buildings. The King has
also declared that if the Meer Akor (who protected
the man that stabbed Sturt) does not
give the assassin up, he will hang the Meer Akor
himself. It appears a very strange circumstance
that troops were not immediately sent into the
city to quell the affair in the commencement;
but we seem to sit quietly with our hands folded,
and look on. On the breaking out of the insurrection
the King sent Campbell's Hindostanee
regiment into the city, with some guns, who
maintained an arduous conflict for some time
against the rebels; but being wholly unsupported,
were obliged eventually to give way, when the
greater part of them were cut to pieces, and
several of their guns were captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
The state of supineness and fancied security of
those in power in cantonments is the result of
deference to the opinions of Lord Auckland,
whose sovereign will and pleasure it is that
tranquillity do reign in Affghanistan; in fact,
it is reported at Government House, Calcutta,
that the lawless Affghans are as peaceable as
London citizens; and this being decided by
the powers that be, why should we be on the
alert?</p>

<p>Most dutifully do we appear to shut our eyes
on our probable fate. The Shah is, however, to
be protected, whatever may be the fate of the
English in the city; and Brig. Shelton is sent with
the Shah's 6th, some of the 44th Queen's, and three
horse artillery guns under Capt. Nicholl, to the
Bala Hissar. The King, as he well may be, is in
great consternation. At about 9 <small>A.M.</small> Capt. Sturt
arrived at Siah Sung from the cantonments, bearing
orders from Major-Gen. Elphinstone for the 54th
N. I., Capt. Nicholl's three horse artillery guns, and
a company of the 44th, accompanied by the Shah's
6th regiment, to hold themselves in readiness to
march at a moment's notice to the Bala Hissar.
As they had all been on the <i>qui vive</i> since daybreak,
they were ready in an instant, and eagerly expecting
orders to march, when a note came from Capt.
Lawrence (the Envoy's military and private secretary),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
dated Bala Hissar, 10 <small>A.M.</small>, telling them,
"Stay where you are,&mdash;all is quiet; you need not
come." This caused great surprise, as the firing
was brisk in the city. After waiting another
hour under arms, the Brigadier ordered Sturt to
go in and see what was going on: this he gladly
did, and, accompanied by eight suwars of the
Shah's 2d cavalry, went to the Bala Hissar. In
half an hour a suwar returned, saying he had been
badly wounded entering the palace gates, and bearing
an order for an immediate advance of the troops.
"Forward" was the word; and, anticipating an
attack on the city, the troops gladly set out, and
arrived unopposed in presence of the King, when,
to their sorrow, instead of receiving <i>hookm</i> to
enter the city, the Shah almost rudely inquired
why they had come! After standing under arms
another hour, firing being heard towards the Shôr
Bazaar, the Brigadier sent Lieut. Melville of the
54th to inquire what was going on. On going
down to the gate towards the city, he found the
fugitives from Campbell's regiment flying in, and
reporting that their regiment was entirely cut up:
this he reported to the Brigadier, who ordered him
to take the light company down to the city gate,
and whilst taking charge of that position to protect
as best he could the retreating regiment. On
arriving there, Lieut. Melville placed a section as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
a guard, and took the remaining three to the entrance
of the Shôr Bazaar, and formed them up
facing the street: he had not been there more than
five minutes, when he observed a disorderly rabble
retreating at a quick pace towards him, pursued
by a large body of Affghans, whilst others from the
tops and windows of the houses kept up a brisk
fire upon them.</p>

<p>Immediately after the colours had gained the
rear of his detachment, Lieut. Melville retreated
slowly, facing the enemy, towards the gate, pouring
in volley on volley; but, owing to the protection
afforded the rebels by the walls, it is to be
feared with but little effect. On reaching the
fosse he formed his men up again, to allow the
two guns to pass to his rear; but the Affghans
made a rush, and the golundaz of the Shah took
to a disorderly flight. As the idea of rescuing
them with three sections was entirely out of the
question, and the fire was becoming very hot,
Melville sent Lieut. Macartney (of the Shah's
service), who in the meantime had come to his
assistance with one company of the Shah's 6th to
man the walls over where the guns were left, and
prevent the enemy carrying them off; this being
done, Melville got a few of the golundaz to go
back and spike one of the guns, after which he retired
inside, having lost one subadar and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
men wounded, and one man killed. On arriving
inside he placed the men on the ramparts; and
being accidentally bayoneted in the thigh, he was
released from duty, making over charge of the
men to Macartney.</p>

<p>It being found impracticable to bring in the
guns, from the carriages being broken, the
European horse artillery, who had been sent out
for that purpose, came back; and some guns
having in the meantime been mounted on the
wall and brought to bear on them, they were so
broken by the shot as to be perfectly useless: and
it may here be remarked, that to the day the
troops left the Bala Hissar, notwithstanding frequent
attempts were made by the enemy, they
never succeeded in gaining possession of them.</p>

<p>The King, who had been in a great state of
excitement during the day, on hearing of the
loss of his guns, and that 200 of Campbell's
regiment had been killed or wounded, was excessively
agitated; the more so that, immediately
on the rebellion breaking out, almost all the
Pesh Khedmuts and Shah Guzees had deserted
him. He ordered a dinner for the officers in
the evening; as, to their extreme disgust, they
were obliged to stay the night in the fort, neither
men or officers having an article of any sort or
kind besides what they wore. The 5th cavalry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
who had accompanied the detachment to the Bala
Hissar, had, after taking all the baggage from
Siah Sung to cantonments, remained in the latter
place.</p>

<p>The King, sitting with the British officers
around him, was anxious to obtain their advice
in the present crisis, and particularly asked that
of &mdash;&mdash;; whose conduct was represented on
the emergency as pitiful and childish in the extreme,
not having a word to say, nor an opinion
to offer.</p>

<p>In cantonments all was confusion and indecision.
The Envoy mounted his horse and rode to
the gateway, and then rode back again,&mdash;the best
thing he could do; for had the Affghans either
killed him or taken him prisoner, it would have
given them a decided advantage on their part.
Sir William and Lady Macnaghten had vacated
the residency before 11 o'clock <small>A.M.</small>, and came
into cantonments; a circumstance which no doubt
was soon known to the insurgents, and must have
given them an idea that we greatly dreaded an
attack from them, which was threatened at night.
The guns were placed in battery, and the walls
manned with double sentries. The Kohistanees
are reported to have 500 men assembled at Deh
Hadji in the Kohistan. The villages about the
Lake are all in a state of insurrection. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
whole force from the Siah Sung cantonments are
come in: the Shah's 6th, the 5th cavalry, Anderson's
horse, and Skinner's are in the Mission Compounds;
the escort in cantonment. Lawrence has
kindly promised in case of an attack to come over
to us; but we are so anxious about Sturt that we
do not think much of danger.</p>

<p>Two Sipahees were cut down near the gate of
the Commissariat Fort to-day; another was killed
who only attempted to cross the road. We have
good news to-day from Sale at Gundamuk, dated
the 1st. They were all quite well, and supplied
with all that they required. Bukhtar Khan, the
new governor there, had sent 500 of his tribe to
Jugdaluk; 250 of Ferris's corps and 300 of Burns's
Khyberries were to follow quickly, to secure the
passes, and open the road to Seh Baba. The
Tagow chief who attacked Sale's force on the
road is said to have withdrawn his men; and now
that all seems clear for our march down, this insurrection
has risen up here. It was only two
days ago Lady Macnaghten told Mrs. Sturt that
the country was all quiet, except the little outbreak
near Tézeen!</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;At three in the morning the drums in
cantonments beat to arms, in consequence of a
large body of men coming over the Siah Sung
hill; they proved to be the 37th from Khoord Cabul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
who, about half-past 2 <small>P.M.</small> yesterday, received
an order to march on its receipt to Cabul. Poshteens
arrived about an hour afterwards in safety,
with no other guard than a couple of suwars; however,
before the regiment was ready to move off
its ground, the Ghilzyes had taken possession of
the mouth of the pass, and were with some difficulty
dislodged by two companies of the 37th, and
two guns of the Shah's mountain train; the latter
under Lieut. Green. The order received by Major
Griffiths to march the detachment under his command
on receipt of the order was accompanied by
a note from Capt. Paton, Assistant Quartermaster-General,
telling Major G. that all Cabul was
in insurrection, &amp;c . The Laird of Pughman (who
had held the pass from the time Sale left Bhoodkhak),
with all his followers, joined our force as
soon as they reached his post, and marched into
Cabul with them. The rear-guard of three companies
and one Mountain T. gun were hard pushed,
as they had to fight all the time the regiment was
getting ready, and also kept up a skirmishing
fight all the way in, in which all the corps joined;
they had four men killed and thirty wounded. The
Mountain T. gun they had in the rear eventually
broke down, but was brought into cantonments.
One officer, Lieut. Gordon, was wounded. Notwithstanding
this, they came in with all their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
baggage in as perfect order as if it had been a
mere parade movement; and great praise is due to
Major Griffiths on this occasion. I observe I have
mentioned the Laird of Pughman,&mdash;a sobriquet
applied to a good man, and a true one to the Shah
and us. His proper name was the Syud Mahommed
Khan; and for the good service he did in the
Kohistan with Sale's force he obtained the honorary
title of Jan Fishan Khan, or the nobleman
who is the exterminator of his sovereign's
enemies. It is a difficult sentence to render into
English.</p>

<p><i>Jan</i> means life; <i>Fishan</i>, heedless of the life
of your enemies; <i>Khan</i>, a lord or nobleman.
I am no linguist myself, but friends who understand
Persian well give the above as the best
translation. The common one is, "The khan
or noble who throws away his life upon his
enemies."</p>

<p>This day there was a great talk of the Kohistanees
being expected to arrive to attack us. The
double sentries are loaded to-day, as also the sentries
placed round the ammunition and stores.</p>

<p>In the evening the rebels appeared in considerable
numbers near Mahommed Khan's Fort,
and between that and the Commissariat Fort, situated
300 yards from cantonments. We have only
three days' provisions in cantonments: should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the Commissariat Fort be captured, we shall not
only lose all our provisions, but our communication
with the city will be cut off.</p>

<p>This fort (an old crazy one, undermined by rats)
contains the whole of the Bengal commissariat
stores, valued at four lakhs of rupees, including
about 12,000 maunds of ottah, wheat, and barley,
and all the medical stores, &amp;c .</p>

<p>No military steps have been taken to suppress
the insurrection, nor even to protect our only means
of subsistence (the Godowns), in the event of a
siege. The King, Envoy, and General appear
perfectly paralysed by this sudden outbreak: the
former is deserted by all his courtiers, and by even
his most confidential servants, except the Wuzeer,
who is strongly suspected of having instigated the
conspiracy; and suspicion attaches to his Majesty
again. It is here necessary to observe, that several
months ago letters calling on all true Mussulmans
to rise against the Kaffirs (English unbelievers)
were widely disseminated: they bore the
King's signature; but Sir William Macnaghten
always insisted that they were forgeries of a very
peculiar description, that papers bearing the veracious
signature had had their contents washed out,
and these seditious writings inserted. The Shah
of course said, "An enemy has done this;" and,
as dead men tell no tales, much of the obloquy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
was allowed to rest on Moollah Shekoor, who had
paid the penalty of other state crimes.</p>

<p>In Affghanistan the English act as they do in
all other countries they visit,&mdash;keep to themselves,
and even (generally) employ only servants brought
with them. The Envoy kept but few Affghans
in his employ: he had a news reporter, at 150 rupees
a month, who had the credit of concocting
splendid untruths; an old moollah picked up at
Kandahar, who, I believe, receives 200,&mdash;a man
greatly in Sir William's confidence; there is also
an old cossid. These people adhere to the Envoy,
and flatter him into the belief that the tumult is
<i>bash</i> (nothing), and will shortly subside.</p>

<p>This day there was a grand bustle, getting guns
into all the bastions. Capt. and Mrs. Trevor, and
their seven children, came into cantonments. Trevor's
Hazir Bashes brought them in safe; but they
had to walk through the river, and to carry the
children, saving only the clothes they had on. As
they escaped at one gate, their tower was taken
possession of by the rebels from another.</p>

<p>That the insurrection could have been easily
crushed at its commencement, is evident from the
circumstance that on the 2d of November a considerable
number of chiefs went to Capt. Trevor's
house to lend him assistance; amongst them were
Osman Khan, Abdool Rahim Khan, Khan Shireen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
Khan, Taj Mahommed, Gholam Moyenoodeen, &amp;c .
The Nawaub Zeman Khan sent one of his younger
children to Trevor, and desired him to keep him
as a hostage; but finding that no assistance came
from cantonments Trevor declined keeping the
boy, and, accompanied by some of the above-mentioned
persons and their followers, he made his
way into cantonments on the 3d.</p>

<p>It is further worthy of remark, that Taj Mahommed
Khan went to Sir Alexander Burnes the
very day before the insurrection broke out, and
told him what was going on. Burnes, incredulous,
heaped abuse on this gentleman's head; and the
only reply he gave him was, "Shuma beseeah
shytan ust!" on which Taj Mahommed left him.
This anecdote was told us by himself.</p>

<p>Two of the Shah's mountain train guns, under
Lieut. Green, and 400 of the 54th N. I., were
sent, escorted by cavalry, to take ammunition and
carcasses to the Bala Hissar, as also bedding for the
men.</p>

<p>There is a report that the city is about to be fired.</p>

<p>A large party bearing the religious flag (green)
came towards the rear gate: they fought with
much <i>jee</i>; but one of our guns played on them,
and then the cavalry dashed out and cut them up.
Lieut. Le Geyt, of the Shah's service, with a small
party of Anderson's horse, feigned to fly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
drew a party after them, on whom they turned
and dealt destruction.</p>

<p>At the Bala Hissar the troops were allotted to
their different stations; though, in consequence of
a great portion of the 54th N. I. being in cantonments,
as yet no permanent division of the troops
could take place.</p>

<p>One of the most important posts was the tower
on the summit of the hill, which was held by 100
men of the 54th, the same number of the King's
Juzailchees, one gun of the mountain train, with
two officers. The centre post, being a commanding
position over the town, was occupied by four
companies of the Shah's 6th, two of Nicholl's H. A.
guns, and some large guns of the King's. The
rest of the troops were scattered in different parts
of the fort, two companies being at each of the
gates.</p>

<p>During this day many projects were entered
into for the purpose of putting down the rebellion,
but none were put into practice. The Wuzeer
went into the town, accompanied by some troops;
but soon returned, having made no impression.
The King wrote to Sir William Macnaghten, proposing
that a free pardon should be offered to all
offenders, and that all should be forgiven and forgotten
if the leaders of the insurrection would
come to his durbar, and, acknowledging their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
faults, return to their allegiance. This, of course,
was never carried into execution. Five companies
of the 54th, commanded by Capt. Corry, accompanied
by some cavalry, arrived; having lost on
the way, between cantonments and the Bala Hissar,
the baggage and clothing of the grenadier and
light companies, who, consequently, were exposed
to the rigorous nights without a single article of
clothing. Although fired on the whole way, they
had only three men wounded. The cavalry returned,
but the 54th remained with the headquarters
of their regiment.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;At two in the morning firing recommenced
at the city. Khan Shireen Khan and
some others are conjectured to have driven the
fighting party out of the city; but we do not hear
of the heads of the faction (Abdoollah Khan, the
proprietor of the Pisheen Valley, Amenoollah
Khan of Logur, and Sekunder Khan) being seized.
The insurgents in great numbers took possession
of Mahmood Khan's fort, the Shah bagh, Mahommed
Shureef's fort, and the garden between
the Godown fort and the fort called the Bazaar
of the European regiment.</p>

<p>Our guns from the south bastion opened early,
and played almost all day on Mahmood Khan's
fort, and on any body of Affghans that showed
themselves. Lieut. Warren, who held the Commissariat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
fort with fifty men, wrote to the General
to say, that, unless reinforced, he could not
hold out; that he was surrounded by the enemy,
who he feared were mining the walls, and they were
preparing ladders for the escalade; adding also
that some of his men had already left him.</p>

<p>In the evening a party of cavalry and infantry
were sent to aid him in evacuating his position!
Capt. Boyd, the Bengal Commissariat officer, on
hearing the object of this force from Capt. Grant
(Assist. Adjt. Gen.), proceeded in person to Gen.
Elphinstone, accompanied by Capt. Johnson (the
Shah's Commissariat officer). They urgently entreated
him to recall them, and, instead, to send
such reinforcements as were required to hold a
position of such vital importance; pointing out the
certain destruction of the whole force in cantonments,
in the event of the capture of all our supplies.
The General acquiesced in their views, and
promised to issue the order for reinforcements.
The above detachment was very shortly obliged to
return to cantonments, having suffered most severely
in men and horses, who were fired upon
from behind every face and from every loophole
of Mahommed Shureef's fort, without their being
able even to see an enemy. Previous to this detachment
going out, a party of Europeans, under
Capt. Robinson, went down the Kohistan road to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
effect the same object. Capt. Robinson (H. M. 44th)
being killed, this small party was obliged to retire,
having suffered severely. Two horse artillery
guns accompanied the party. Lieut. Waller,
H. A., and Lieut. Fortye, 44th, were wounded.
The whole of this occurred within 250 paces of
the south bastion. In the evening no reinforcements
had been sent to Warren, and the two heads
of the Commissariats, Johnson and Boyd, again
went to the General, to entreat he would not lose
any more time in sending aid to that officer, and
informed him there were but two days' provisions
left in cantonments; pointed out the great fears
entertained that we could not procure supplies
from the surrounding country, with the enemy in
force in the neighbouring forts, and the consequent
destruction of our force from famine, unless the
Godown fort were taken possession of at all hazards.
The General conceded to these opinions.
As Mahommed Shureef's fort commanded the only
gate of the Commissariat fort, it would be requisite
first to take possession of that fort. The political
authorities had no persons from whom they could
obtain information! For a reward of fifty rupees
one of Johnson's servants proceeded to the fort, and
brought back intelligence (in about half an hour)
that he saw twenty or thirty men with lighted
matchlocks sitting on either side of the wicket:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
he judged, from the silence that prevailed, there
were but few then within, and affirmed there
were none on the road. Johnson subsequently
sent another man, who confirmed the reports, but
did not see any lights near the wicket. All this
was made known to Gen. Elphinstone, who determined
on taking possession of the fort, and
Capt. Boyd volunteered to carry the powder to
blow in the gate. The General, however, afterwards
listened to other advice from other of his
staff officers, who were averse to the proceeding,
as involving too much risk! During this time
another letter was received from Lieut. Warren
by the adjutant of his regiment, stating that
unless he was immediately reinforced, he must
abandon his position, as many of his guard had
gone over the wall to cantonments, by which his
force was much weakened. Capt. Boyd and Johnson
left the General about midnight under the
impression that Mahomed Shureef's fort would
be immediately attacked and the Commissariat
one reinforced.</p>

<p>A letter was written by order (by Capt. Bellew)
to assure Lieut. Warren that he should receive
reinforcements by two o'clock in the morning.
Capt. Mackenzie held his (the King's Commissariat)
fort until his ammunition was entirely
expended, and then cut his way through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
town; but in so doing was wounded in three
places. Strange to say, this officer owed his life
to beating a woman! He told his people to abandon
their property and save their lives. A woman
put down her child to save her pots and pans; and
expostulation being of little effect, and time most
precious, Mackenzie drew his sword to strike her
with the flat of it, by which means he had it in
his hand when he was attacked immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Trevor's tower has been burnt. Had reinforcements
and ammunition been sent to Trevor's
tower and Mackenzie's fort, they might
have held out for ever against any force the rebels
could have brought against them. The Hazir
Bashes refused to stay to defend them, because
they saw they must be sacrificed, and that no
reinforcements were sent. Had they arrived, the
Kuzzilbashes would have declared openly in our
favour, with Khan Shireen Khan at their head;
but unless supported by us, they dreaded giving
offence to the insurgents.</p>

<p>Another party has been sent out with guns;
it is said they are to fire the city, but most likely
it will be a mere demonstration. Such it has
proved. The guns were sent to take possession
of the Lahore Gate; they got not quite to Mahmood
Khan's fort, and had to come back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
The enemy have now possession of the Commissariat
fort, the fort opposite the Bazaar fort,
or Mahommed Shureef's, and the Shah bagh; the
two latter posts appear to have been left unoccupied
for the enemy's especial advantage.</p>

<p>The only mortar we have being a five-and-half-inch
one, has little more effect than a popgun of
large calibre.</p>

<p>A gun has been sent to attempt to blow open
the gate of the Shah bagh, which Sturt says will
be a work of time with a gun; and they cannot use
a powder-bag, as the gate is not <i>get-at-able</i> for the
crowds of people fighting all the way from the
Bazaar fort to the Shah bagh, and thence to the
city.</p>

<p>A large party of horsemen have shown themselves
coming down the Siah Sung hill: the
cavalry are sent to look after them. Mahmood
Khan's fort is occupied by the enemy, who are
to be shelled out, it is said; but we have been
throwing shells into the small fort opposite the
Bazaar (Mahommed Shureef's) since 12 o'clock,
and now at 4 they are still at it, and seem to have
done nothing.</p>

<p>A Kulassy of Capt. Maule's has just come in
from the Kohistan half naked: he reports, that the
Kohistanees are all up; that Maule and Wheeler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
were killed at Kar Durrah, and that they were
overpowered.</p>

<p>This day Lieut. Gordon, of the 37th, was killed;
Capt. Swayne, 44th, ditto; Lieut. Walsh, of the
Shah's service, wounded in the thigh; Hallahan,
44th, in the shoulder; Warren, 54th, wounded;
Capt. Robinson and four men, 44th, killed, and
sixteen wounded.</p>

<p>The cavalry had brought in six wounded, and
had thirty-one missing at 5 o'clock. The 5th cavalry
went up to the gate of the Shah bagh in
gallant style; but it was shut too quickly for
them to get in. Hamilton's horse shot under him
in the ditch under the gate.</p>

<p>At tea-time we had an alarm, and very smart
firing like a <i>feu de joie</i>; but it was a false alarm.
I believe no enemy was seen: it occurred on the
rampart near to Sale's bastion.</p>

<p>After we had, as we thought, settled poor Sturt
for the night, between 8 and 9 o'clock Capt.
Lawrence came to see him and ask his advice.
Sturt had wished to have communicated with the
General on the defence of the cantonments, and,
ill as he was, he had written a letter to him; but
thinking that advice from so young an officer
might not be relished, he, notwithstanding my
remonstrances on the subject, tore it up. About
10 o'clock, Lieut. Eyre, Deputy Commissary of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Ordnance, and Capt. Warburton, the Shah's Topshee
Bashee, came; and as they had received information
that there are men posted outside the
gate of the captured fort, with matchlocks all
ready, the plan in agitation of blowing open the
gate with a bag of powder would not answer:
they, therefore, with Sturt, decided on getting
the two nine-pounders into the bastion, and on setting
to work forthwith to cut the embrasures to fit
them; and between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning
was fixed upon as the time to commence
playing on the fort to breach it, and at the same
time to throw in a proportion of shells to create
confusion. The place to be taken by assault. If
this does not succeed, we shall probably have to
retreat to Jellalabad. Sturt strongly advises the
troops being all thrown into the Bala Hissar, and
the cantonments being abandoned until we get up
reinforcements; but the cry is, how can we abandon
the cantonments that have cost us so much
money?</p>

<p>The enemy's force are estimated at from 1500
to 2000. Brig. Shelton is expected in from the
Bala Hissar, where they are said to be short of
provisions. Here we got six seers of ottah for the
rupee yesterday, but to-day none is procurable.
The servants are to get half rations from the commissariat
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
At the Bala Hissar two companies!!! were
warned for service under Capt. Corri, 54th, for the
purpose of entering the town to cause a diversion
during the expected attack which it was understood
there was about to be made from cantonments.
However it was, as usual, only one of the theoretical
plans so often talked of, and so little practised.
Conolly, Troup, and Hay had gone there for the
purpose of assisting with counsel; but there was
"great cry and little wool," and nothing was done.</p>

<p>The supplies are become very limited, and it
becomes a question how the troops and Horse Artillery
horses are to be fed: to-day there were only
three days' provisions left; but owing to the great
exertions of Capt. Kirby, Acting Assistant Commissary-General,
a very large quantity was laid in,
Damel Khan and Timor Khan, two Armenian
merchants, being very instrumental in procuring
them. Immediately in the neighbourhood of the
Bala Hissar were fields of wheat stretching out
for many acres; the wheat being the second crops,
and some half a foot high, was found to be excellent
food for the cattle: the groves also, in the
vicinity, were all cut down for firewood, which,
as long as it lasted, was very liberally distributed
to the troops by the King.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;At 5 o'clock <small>A.M.</small>, no reinforcement
having gone to the assistance of Lieut. Warren,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
although promised by 2, that officer vacated the
Commissariat fort. No blame can attach to him,
but much to those who withheld aid. The enemy
took possession, depriving us of our only means of
subsistence. Nor was this all the mischief: it
gave both confidence and much plunder to the
enemy, and created great disgust amongst the
Europeans, who lost all their rum; a worse loss
was all the medical stores, sago, arrow-root, wine,
&amp;c . for the sick.</p>

<p>The men in cantonments were employed all
day, the guns and mortars throwing shot and shell
at the Mahommed Shureef's fort; Major Swayne
being ordered with a very insufficient force to
attack it, only two companies with two Horse Artillery
guns, under Lieut. Eyre. The latter were
ordered to be placed on the Kohistan road, outside
the gate of cantonments, and to keep up a heavy
fire on the fort; whilst Major Swayne was to advance
rapidly on the fort, and blow open the
gate with a bag of powder. Lieut. Eyre obeyed
his orders; but his ammunition was all expended
before the arrival of Major Swayne's party, who,
instead of advancing, had, on a fire of matchlocks
being opened from the fort, taken cover under
some walls from the heavy fire of the enemy; and
having expended all their ammunition ineffectually,
the whole had to retire with some loss of men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
horses. This was the only opportunity that offered
of retrieving our loss. The enemy were busied in
hundreds all day in carrying off our stores, all
which we plainly saw from cantonments. The
troops retired by order of Gen. Elphinstone, to my
no small surprise, for the enemy had begun to run
out from a broken bastion; but when they found
our people retreating, they took courage, and no
more left the fort, on which shot and shell kept
playing all day. After stating this, it is unnecessary
to add that Sturt's suggestions had not been
acted on.</p>

<p>When the 44th retreated from Mahommed
Shureef's fort, all were in amazement; the 37th
asked leave to go and take it, but were not permitted
to do so. The Sipahees are grumbling at
short allowance, and not being allowed to do any
thing. The 37th were anxious to be employed in
recovering the Commissariat fort, though no actual
proposition to that effect was officially made
to the General.</p>

<p>On this day a report was carried to the King
and Conolly that the rebels had mined from the
Shôr Bazaar to immediately under H. M.'s palace,
which said mine was to be sprung the same evening.
The King instantly left the palace, and took
up his abode at the Gate of the Haram Serai, where
he remained during the rest of the siege; and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
day, seated at a window commanding a fine view of
cantonments, telescope in hand, watched anxiously
the course of passing events in that place. He was
at this time quite sunk into a state of despondency,
and would gladly seize any opportunity of asking
the opinion of any of the officers as to what was
likely to be the issue of the struggle. He put off for
the time all the insignia of royalty, made the officers
sit by him on chairs, and seemed quite <i>gobrowed</i>
(an expressive eastern term, to be rendered something
between dumbfounded and at one's wits' end).
The Shah's conduct in the particular of the chairs
is the more worthy of remark, as he had been in
the habit of keeping the officers for hours standing
with folded hands silently in his presence, and then
ungraciously dismissing them without even a passing
remark. He now sent to each Sahib a warm
silk resaiz and a pillow, which were very acceptable,
as they were all starving with cold.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Major Kershaw, Lieut. Hobhouse, and
eleven soldiers of the 13th Lt. Inf. (who had been
left at Cabul in consequence of illness) this day
volunteered their services.</p>

<p>Sturt, having fretted himself half mad at every
thing going wrong, determined, weak and ill as he
was, to go out and do his duty. He is the only
engineer officer at Cabul. He was unable to dress,
but went out in his shirt and pyjania to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
works. Although he was out himself a little
after 6 o'clock, he could not get things or people
into their places until 10. General Elphinstone
gave him permission to make any arrangements he
considered as safe from chance of failure for taking
the small fort; but when he had with great exertion
got three nine-pounders and two twenty-four
pound howitzers at work (the latter across the
road), Major Thain was sent to him to desire he
would be careful not to expend ammunition, as
powder was scarce! there being at the time a
sufficiency for a twelvemonths' siege! However,
Sturt made no alteration in his proceedings, and
by 12 o'clock an excellent breach was made, the
bastion being thrown down and great part of the
curtain, so that ladders were not required: the
gate was blown in at the same time by Capt.
Bellew, Assist.-Adjt.-Gen. There was a small
crack in the rampart near Sale's bastion, of which
I used to take advantage, as a stepping-stone to
enable me to see what was going on; and from
my position I saw the storming party ascend the
breach, under a heavy fire, with a commendable
steadiness and great alacrity: they quickly drove
the enemy from their stations, who then escaped
through the wicket into the Shah's garden. The
storming party was commanded by Major Griffith,
of the 37th N. I., consisting of the light company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
of the Queen's 44th, Lieut. Hobhouse and ten
men of H. M. 13th Lt. Inf., one company of 5th
N. I., one company 37th N. I.; in all about 150
men. Lieut. Raban, 44th, killed whilst waving
his sword on the highest point of the breach;
Mr. Deas, 5th, wounded. I believe we had
nineteen killed, and several wounded; amongst
the latter, one of the 13th. The flag taken from
the enemy was waved on the crest of the breach
by a Sipahee of the 37th, who captured it, and
who was promoted for the act. He and a havildar
of the same corps, though belonging to
the rear company, were, with Lieut. Raban, the
first into the fort. But few of the enemy were
found killed; but it is difficult to estimate the
numbers of their slain, as they are so particular
regarding Moslem burial that they always, when
practicable, drag the bodies away. Great numbers
escaped to the hills behind, which were
quickly covered with horsemen, from 2000 to
3000 men. A party of Anderson's horse charged
straight up the hill (just to the left of the gorge
leading to the lake) in most gallant style, and
drove the enemy along the ridge to the extreme
left. Meantime, the 5th cavalry rode along the
foot of the hill to the left, and charged up at that
end; by which man&oelig;uvre the enemy were hemmed
in, in the centre of the two cavalry corps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
when a very severe encounter took place. From
the top of our house we saw every thing distinctly;
the gleaming of their swords in the sun,
and the fire of their pistols and matchlocks:
fresh horsemen came pouring on to the assistance
of the enemy from the back of the hill; they
buried our cavalry and Anderson's horse, who,
overpowered by numbers and a most galling fire,
were forced along the ridge to the spot whence
the first charge took place.</p>

<p>The Affghans have many advantages over our
troops: one consists in dropping their men fresh
for combat; each horseman takes a foot soldier up
behind him, and drops him when he is arrived
at the spot he is required to fire from. Their
horsemen are either gentlemen or yeomen (as
we should denominate them), all well mounted,
and their baggage ponies can manage the hills
much better than our cavalry horses; in fact,
the Affghan horses seem to me to climb about
with as much unconcern as goats do. As
regards pistols, we are on a par, as most of
theirs have been presents from the Posha
Khana; but their juzails carry much further
than our muskets, and, whilst they are out
of range of our fire, theirs tells murderously
on us.</p>

<p>A standard bearer with a white flag was killed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
he was evidently a person of some consequence,
from the great anxiety evinced to obtain possession
of his body. There were two red flags in
another division.</p>

<p>Capt. Anderson distinguished himself, killing
four men with his own hand; he rode up the
gorge to challenge the enemy again, but they had
the advantage of position, and would not come
down.</p>

<p>The enemy continued to crown the heights:
our guns were out of range, and the shot fell
short. We had infantry out in skirmishing order,
but the whole was little more than a very exciting
and provoking spectacle; for we made little impression,
although the whole of our cavalry was
out: so cavalry, infantry, guns, and all, came back
again, and soon after the enemy came down the
hill, some evidently returning to the Shah bagh,
and others dispersing more to the left, and probably
returning to the city.</p>

<p>Lady Macnaghten told me to-day that Sir
William had written to inform Sale that we had
been in siege since the 2d, and to request his
return with the force under his command; to
leave the sick and wounded in safety at Gundamuk,
under charge of the troops there. To this
the General assented, and signed the letter; but
afterwards he said it would be abandoning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
sick and baggage, and refused to recall Sale's
brigade.</p>

<p>I was asked if I could send a letter from Sir
William to Sale, through Sturt's influence with
the natives; but if, with secret service money at
his command, the Envoy cannot bribe a messenger,
how are poor people like us to do so?</p>

<p>Sir William has given one of the Kuzzilbash
chiefs 50,000 rupees to raise a diversion in our
favour, and has promised him two lakhs more if
he succeeds.</p>

<p>The insurgent chiefs have set up a king, and a
wuzeer; they went to the mosque, and read the
fatcha, or prayer, for the reigning monarch.
Several of the Moollahs refused to recognise the
name of Shah Zeman: they said they would
allow that of Shah Shoojah as a legitimate monarch.
There was a long and wordy dispute;
but Shah Mahommed Zeman seems at present to
possess most power in Cabul. This is not the
blind Shah Zeman, Shah Shoojah's brother, but
a relation of the Ameer Dost Mahommed. He is
an old man, and said to be the son of an elder
brother of Dost Mahommed's, and used to be
called the Nawaub. He has struck coin in his own
name.</p>

<p>Abdoollah Khan has sent a messenger to treat
with the King, who replied that he would receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
no such low person, and that some person of respectability
must be sent. The King is also said to
have seized the man who stabbed Sturt, and to
have declared his intent to put him to death; but
just now I believe he dares not do so.</p>

<p>This day there was a report that Sir Alexander
Burnes and his brother were still living, but that
the people, in whose power they were, were treating
for a very large ransom.</p>

<p>Capt. Warburton left two guns in the city at
his house; the Affghans have taken possession of
them (six-pounders), and use them against us
either with their own balls, or ours returned to us
in that manner. They hammer our nine-pound
shot into an egg shape. One of them that fell
in Sturt's compound attracted attention, as we all
supposed that they could not be hammered to fit
other guns.</p>

<p>Paton and Bellew meet in council with Sturt
at nine most evenings at our house. To-day arrangements
were made for carrying the Shah's
garden and the Commissariat fort at daybreak,
every thing being so clearly explained that even I
understood it as well as hemming the handkerchief
I was making. The captured fort, as it is called,
is now held by three companies. It is proposed
to be blown up: they are quietly to cut embrasures
in the wall for three guns, to cover the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
attack on the garden. There is to be a simultaneous
attack on the Commissariat fort; and the
signal for escalading the breach with a company
of Europeans, and one of natives, will be the
explosion in blowing up the gate. Plans were
sketched, and all the minutiæ written out, so that
the General might have no questions to ask. It is
now midnight, and no reply has been sent from
him, though an answer was to have come to say
whether the work should be done or not.</p>

<p>This day Gen. Elphinstone wrote to the Envoy
to state that we were in want of ammunition, requesting
him to endeavour to make arrangements
with the enemy!</p>

<p>Capt. Bellew told me that the General has at
length agreed that Sale's brigade shall be recalled.
Had we more men, a brigade might be sent out
on the hill, to punish the enemy who defy us
there.</p>

<p>The men are greatly harassed; their duty is
very heavy, and they have no cover night or day,
all being on the ramparts. The weather is cold,
particularly at night.</p>

<p>There was a good store of grain in the captured
fort, but very little of it was brought into cantonments
by the Commissariat, though a great deal
found its way into the Bunneahs' shops, or was
carried off by the Sipahees and camp-followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
A great quantity of wheat has been brought in
to-day and yesterday from the villages, and we
are promised further supplies.</p>

<p>A note from Thain mentions that Sale has been
sent for, but, from the very cautious wording of the
order, it appears doubtful whether he can take
such responsibility upon himself as it implies.
He is, if he can leave his sick, wounded, and baggage
in perfect safety, to return to Cabul, if he
can do so without endangering the force under his
command. Now, in obeying an order of this
kind, if Sale succeeds, and all is right, he will
doubtless be a very fine fellow; but if he meets
with a reverse, he will be told, "You were not
to come up unless you could do so safely!"</p>

<p>There has been much talk of bringing Brig.
Shelton from the Bala Hissar into cantonments,
to aid with counsel and prowess; the plan is, however,
for the present abandoned.</p>

<p>The troops in the Bala Hissar are better off
than we are, as there are yet some supplies in the
shops there, though at an exorbitant rate.</p>

<p>Despatches have been sent for reinforcements
from Kandahar. If Gen. Nott's brigade had not
proceeded on their way to the provinces further
than the Kojuk pass, they are to return.</p>

<p>Accounts have been received that Codrington's
corps at Charikar is surrounded. Capt. Rattray,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
the political agent there, and Lieut. Salisbury,
killed. Capt. Codrington and the other officers
wounded, as also Major Pottinger, political agent.</p>

<p>There has been great talk of withdrawing the
troops from the Bala Hissar into cantonments;
but if this were done, the King, with his 800
ladies (wives, daughters, &amp;c ., and their attendants),
would follow, and we should soon be starved out.
If we make an inglorious retreat to Hindostan,
he will still accompany us; and as we brought
him to the country, we must stand by him.</p>

<p>When there was first an intention of building
for the army at the Company's expense, Capt.
Sturt gave it as his decided opinion, (which
opinion is on record in the letter book of his
office, in a letter to Sir A. Burnes,) that the garrison
should be placed in the Upper Bala Hissar,
from whence (with plenty of ammunition and food,
which might always be procured from the city,
either purchased from friends, or taken zubberdust
from the enemy) we never could be dislodged.
A large outlay (I write from memory,
and therefore do not name a sum) was expended
in commencing barracks, bombproofs, &amp;c .; and
last, not least, a new wing was added to a palace
for the Envoy, and another, to make all square,
was laid out, when the King sent to say he
would neither have the Envoy nor the troops in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
the Bala Hissar: so all the money spent was
thrown away, and the King had the new wing
and the whole palace thrown down because it
was originally erected by the Dost.</p>

<p>The camp was pitched at Siah Sung; but that
site would not answer for a cantonment for many
reasons detailed by Sturt in his public letter,
which I propose appending to my Journal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
I shall therefore only notice two of them,&mdash;the
distance from good water, and the whole spot
being commanded by the heights that surround it,
except on one side, which is a morass, and from
that cause not particularly healthy at some seasons.</p>

<p>There was ground on the further side of the
city, but that would not answer, as should an
insurrection occur in Cabul it would cut off our
communication with Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Eventually the King gave up a garden or
orchard, the present site of cantonments, with
water at hand, good and plentiful, and always
procurable by digging two feet for it in any
direction.</p>

<p>Sturt urges the absolute necessity of our now
withdrawing our forces from the cantonments
into the Bala Hissar, but is still met by the cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
of, "How can we abandon the good buildings
and property?"</p>

<p>The ammunition might be buried and concealed,
the guns spiked, &amp;c .; but a great deal of
the former might be sent into the Bala Hissar by
the cavalry carrying each man a proportion on
his horse nightly, and many of the latter might
be taken to the citadel.</p>

<p>To Sergt. Deane, of the engineers' department,
the army are very greatly indebted for his great
personal exertions in getting in grain. He is a
particularly intelligent man, and very superior to
his present station in life; and the fluency with
which he speaks Persian enables him to pick up
information, and also to go about at times in disguise
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If we can only continue to obtain provisions
as we have done for the last two days, we shall be
able to hold out on half rations, and in another
month, it is said, the Kohistanees cannot touch us
for the snow, which fell heavily on the hills last
night.</p>

<p>We had rain here late in the evening, and at
night; and this morning I saw a great increase in
the snow on the hills.</p>

<p>In the Bala Hissar, Lieut. Melville having
recovered from his wound sufficiently to do his
duty, was sent down to take charge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
Lahore gate of the fort, which was now the only
opening into the Bala Hissar, the others having
been built up with almost solid masonry.</p>

<p>The troops there were isolated in a fort closely
besieged, actually without a single case of amputating
or other surgical instruments amongst them,
and hardly a grain of medicine!&mdash;most culpable
negligence, as they might easily have been sent
from the cantonments, though a little foresight
would have suggested their being taken there with
the troops; and they might easily have been got
ready during the time they were under arms&mdash;more
than an hour&mdash;before they marched.</p>

<p>There has been constant firing for the last day
or two on the city side of the fort, and the enemy
have made several unsuccessful attempts to carry
off the two guns that are lying beneath the walls.
Food is already scarce in the bazaar; and although
plenty is stored up in the private houses of the
natives, yet in the shops the price of two seers of
wheat or two and a half is a rupee.</p>

<p>The Sipahees complain bitterly of the severity
of the weather, particularly at night, and above
sixty men are in hospital at the Bala Hissar already,
besides the wounded: they are attacked with
pneumonia, which carries them off in the course of
a couple of days. The King sent strict orders to
Melville at the gate, to allow no one to pass either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
in or out without a pass from either the wuzeer
or Conolly, except the surwans in charge of the
grazing cattle which go out at 8 <small>A.M.</small> and return
at 2, protected by a resallah of the King's Sikh
regt.: in case of an alarm from without, a flag is
ordered to be waved from the ramparts, on which
signal all the cattle are immediately to come in.
The above-mentioned resallah are, without any exception,
the worst set-up and most disorderly body
of troops calling themselves a regiment that can be
imagined: their horses are ill-conditioned, their
arms and accoutrements nominal, as each man
dresses as he pleases, a stick with a bayonet on
the top being the sole offensive weapon of many
of them. And this is the imperial guard of the
monarch of Affghanistan! Besides this regiment
his majesty has with him in the fort, of his own
troops (not reckoning those of the subsidiarised
force), his orderly regiment (Campbell's), 400
Juzailchees, and 500 of another Hindostanee
regt. The orderly regiment are certainly better
men of the sort (not being the Company's soldiers)
than are usually met with, although they did run
away in the city on the 2nd, but it was not until
they had lost 200 men and fought gallantly. Campbell
himself is the King's right-hand man.</p>

<p>Associated with Melville at the gate was Raja
Jeenial Sing, a man whose father was prince of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
extensive territory lying near Cashmere, and who,
when Shah Shoojah in 1818 was a fugitive and
an exile flying from Runjeet Sing, received him
most kindly, gave him all he asked for: refusing
every offer or command of Runjeet to surrender
him up, he transported him safely to the Company's
territories. For this, Runjeet deprived
him of his Raj, valued at four lakhs yearly, and
all his property, imprisoning both him and his
sons: the latter on their father's death made their
escape and arrived at the court of Shah Shoojah,
for whose sake they had lost every thing. His
gratitude was shown in the regal donation of two
rupees eight anas daily!! Verily they had their
reward, and well may they exclaim, "Put not
your trust in princes!"</p>

<p>From an idea of an insurrection being about to
take place among the Arabs (who compose a large
portion of the inhabitants), a proposal was set on
foot for turning all the Affghans, &amp;c . out of the
Bala Hissar, and taking all provisions found for the
use of the troops both there and in cantonments.
This, as well as every other energetic measure
proposed, was knocked on the head either by the
King or the politicals, and, instead of turning out
all useless hands, an order was issued to allow no
woman to pass the gate unless supplied with a
pass, as an idea had got afloat that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
about to turn out their wives and children ere a
general massacre of the troops took place. However,
in lieu of an insurrection, food becoming
very scarce, all the natives became clamorous for
permission to leave the fort, and go into the city
with their wives and children,&mdash;"a consummation
devoutly to be wished," and to insure which it
had been good policy to have paid them a high
price for their houses and grain, &amp;c . This the
King positively refused to allow, but ordered a
Shah-Gazee to join Melville at the gate, and,
having examined them one by one to see that they
carried out no arms, to allow females to pass;
but no man to go on any account. In this way,
in three days were passed out 750 women with
their children, which was at least a good riddance!</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;I did not go to bed till after Mr. Eyre
went away this morning: he came at a little after
midnight in consequence of some frivolous objections
of the General's, based I believe mostly on
Capt. Bellew's doubts as to whether the trees in
the garden next the Commissariat fort were
planted in lines parallel to the wall or not. Now
Bellew always has an "observation" to throw in,
or "begs to suggest" something. He had acknowledged
he had never been in this garden, though
Sturt had; neither could he be made to understand
that it was the custom of the country to plant the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
trees in lines parallel with the outer walls: neither
could he comprehend, that if even a tree
intervened, a shot would destroy it from the
heavy nine-pounders. These trees were not gigantic
English oaks, the growth of a century;
but fruit trees.</p>

<p>The heavy iron nines would now have proved
their utility against the fort, but the old objection
of the difficulty of transporting them over bad
roads still exists; an iron nine cannot be as portable
as a brass six-pounder, but the eighteen-pounders
would not have given much more trouble than the
nines did on the march up, and would have done
us good service had we them here. Capt. Abbott
wrote for 3 eighteen-pounders; the military board
made it a case of arithmetic, and sent 6 nines; and
as they had to be taken up the hills by hand, a
little more manual labour would have transported
the others also over the Affghanee mountains.</p>

<p>I often hear the Affghans designated as cowards:
they are a fine manly-looking set, and I can only
suppose it arises from the British idea among civilised
people that assassination is a cowardly act.
The Affghans never scruple to use their long knives
for that purpose, <i>ergo</i> they are cowards; but they
show no cowardice in standing as they do against
guns without using any themselves, and in escalading
and taking forts which we cannot retake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
The Affghans of the capital are a little more
civilised; but the country gentlemen and their
retainers are, I fancy, much the same kind of
people as those Alexander encountered.</p>

<p>The Juzailchees were sent out to skirmish: they
attacked the Shah bagh, and cleared the west end
of it; they then joined Major Thain, who, with a
squadron of horse and two companies of infantry,
attacked a garden beyond it, drove the enemy
out with great slaughter, and burnt the garden
house. Lieut. Eyre at the same time, through a
small opening in the wall of the Shah bagh immediately
under the captured fort, played with a six-pounder
upon the gate of the garden. Not being
supported, however, these advantages were lost, and
the enemy being reinforced in great numbers, the
above troops were forced to retreat, having lost a
considerable number of men; <i>par exemple</i>, fifteen of
the Juzailchees out of ninety-five were left on the
field. I have not the actual numbers of the Europeans
and Sipahees who were slain.</p>

<p>The gun was saved with great difficulty, and
here a great fault was committed in sending one gun
only. In the Marquis of Hastings's time an order
was published prohibiting a single gun being sent
out, in consequence of the disastrous consequences
attending its being unsupported during the Nepalese
war. But all seems confusion here. Those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
who, at the head of affairs, ought to have been directing
every thing, appear to be in consternation.
General Elphinstone from his first arrival in the
country was in ill health, which gradually increased
on him, till his mind became nearly as
much enervated as his body; and so conscious was
he of his own state, that he had written to Government
to give up the command, and also to
Gen. Nott at Kandahar to come up and take his
place until a new commander of the forces was
appointed.</p>

<p>We are now in circumstances which require a
man of energy to cope with them. Major Thain
is said to be a good adviser, but unfortunately it
is not always in the multitude of counsellors that
there is wisdom; and so many proffered their advice
and crossed his, that Thain withdrew his, and only
now answers such questions as are put to him.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;At four in the morning a sharp firing was
heard, for which at the time we could not account,
but afterwards found that it proceeded from the
captured fort, which the enemy had attempted to
mine and recapture. They had succeeded in
making a large hole, but being repulsed they set
the fort on fire. At daybreak, finding Sturt's
servant still in the verandah, and knowing that
his master was to have been up at half-past four,
I went to the door to inquire, and found that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
the General, or rather his advisers, had decided
that nothing was to be done.</p>

<p>The enemy are using our guns against us,
throwing shot into cantonments from Mahmood
Khan's fort.</p>

<p>Our men are so overworked that it is intended
to give them rest to-day.</p>

<p>Sturt went out early this morning, and found
the garden next the Commissariat fort unoccupied;
he immediately took the sappers under Lieut. Laing
with fifty of the Juzailchees under Mackenzie to
cover them, and sent for two companies of Sipahees
as a covering party whilst they pulled down the
wall, which was quickly accomplished.</p>

<p>There is a report that we are to be attacked in
cantonments to-night. Sturt went to Gen. Elphinstone
and Brig. Anquetil, who both gave him
<i>carte blanche</i>, and desired that all his instructions
should be obeyed. He has accordingly placed 15
guns in position. We have only two artillery
officers in cantonments that are available, now
Waller is wounded; they are Eyre and Warburton.
We have no laboratory men,&mdash;no other
engineer officer than Sturt, who, weak as he is,
has to do every thing.</p>

<p>When we came into cantonments last November,
Sir Willoughby Cotton commanded the
forces in Affghanistan; and Sale, as the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
here, and commandant in cantonments, had the
troops paraded and their posts assigned, in case of
any sudden attack. These troops (the 1st brigade),
who knew their posts, are now far from us, and
no arrangement of a similar kind has been made
since their departure; so Sturt has had the officers
told off to their several stations, has paraded them
at them, and goes his rounds before he goes to bed
to see that they are all at their posts.</p>

<p>It is said that Mohun Lull has named the man
who killed poor Sir Alexander Bumes; he also
writes that there are only 500 Kohistanees in the
city, and that otherwise all is going on well in
the Kuzzilbash quarter of the city, where he resides.</p>

<p>It was reported to-day that the city was on
fire, but it proved to be a village fired by the
Kohistanees.</p>

<p>Conolly writes from the Bala Hissar, accounting
for the firing we heard this morning. An
attack was made on the Bala Hissar, which was
repulsed: the enemy were seized with a panic,
fancied they were attacked from the rear, and
began to fight amongst themselves; cries of <i>Aman</i>
were heard in cantonments by several persons
besides myself. Conolly also writes that he has
not only heard that we are to be attacked to-night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
but that the enemy are making up bhoosa bags
with which to fill up the ditch.</p>

<p>Sturt is gone to lie down to recruit his
strength, knowing that I never dose now till
daylight, but sit up to watch passing events, and
give the alarm if need be, and have kept my
nightly watch ever since the insurrection commenced.
Our troops as yet are staunch; and if
we are attacked, and succeed in repelling the
enemy, we shall be able to keep our own until
Sale's brigade arrives.</p>

<p>The enemy showed to-day on the heights, in
force about 3000; but we cannot cope with them,
so content ourselves by throwing shrapnell at
them. Eyre threw some with great precision;
the distance was, however, very great, and we
consequently did little execution. We also
greatly feel the want of laboratory men to cut
fuzees, &amp;c .</p>

<p>Sturt asked for a party to occupy the village
of Behmaru, but it was not given. The Envoy
was anxious to secure this place, but all was in
vain; and as we neglected our advantages, the
enemy availed themselves of them, and Meer
Musjudee threw himself and 1000 followers into
it. We have thereby lost 900 maunds of ottah,
which was paid for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
Two forts near the village are in our possession.</p>

<p>An attack expected at about 3 o'clock this
afternoon.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton came in from the Bala Hissar
with six companies of the Shah's 6th, one horse
artillery gun, and one of the mountain train.</p>

<p>The people in cantonments expect wonders
from his prowess and military judgment. I am
of a different opinion, knowing that he is not a
favourite with either his officers or men, and is
most anxious to get back to Hindostan. I must,
however, do him the justice to say that I believe
he possesses much personal bravery; but, notwithstanding,
I consider his arrival as a dark cloud
overshadowing us. Most glad shall I be to find
that, by his energy, the General is roused up to
active measures. It is, perhaps, a part of his
complaint (but, nevertheless, equally unfortunate
for us), that Gen. Elphinstone vacillates on every
point. His own judgment appears to be good,
but he is swayed by the last speaker; and Capt.
Grant's cold cautiousness, and Capt. Bellew's
doubts on every subject, induce our chief to alter
his opinions and plans every moment.</p>

<p>At the Bala Hissar they began to be much
cramped in their correspondence with cantonments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
which became very limited; a hurkaru
stealing out at night, and returning with an
answer early in the morning, being now the only
means of communication; and the same man
never went for more than five days without being
either killed or confined.</p>

<p>The Affghans, having persons who can read
English, French, and Latin, were aware of all
our secrets.</p>

<p>Mohun Lull and the Naïb Shureef were our
newsgivers from the city, and always gave intelligence
of the arrival of any new chief or body of
troops; also doing, or saying they were doing, all
in their power to enter into some sort of terms.
The King is gradually getting worse and worse,
and has quite lost all his self-possession. He has
warned the females of his zenana (amounting in
number to 860) that in the event of the cantonments
falling into the hands of the rebels he
should administer poison to them all! At least
these are the reports gathered from his few immediate
attendants; how far they may be relied
on as true, or whether they are merely set afloat
to blind us to his own share in the insurrection, it
is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton made over the command to Major
Ewart, 54th N. I., and left the Bala Hissar at
4 <small>A.M.</small>, and arrived in cantonments before daybreak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
without meeting with any opposition on
the road.</p>

<p>The troops were left in position as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the city gate of the fort were 2 companies of
the 54th, 1 gun horse artillery, 1 of the mountain
train. At the centre square above the palace 2
companies 54th, 2 guns horse artillery, 1 eighteen-pounder,
and just under it a nine-pounder. The
Sikh horse encamped in the square.</p>

<p>At the Lahore gate, 100 men of the 54th under
Lieut. Melville, with 50 of the Shah's Juzailchees.
On a bastion to the left of the Haram Khana, 1
company of the 54th. On the upper tower of
the fort, commanding the whole, 100 of the 54th,
100 Juzailchees, and 1 gun of the mountain train.
The remainder were in reserve at the palace
square, with their different parts allotted to them
in case of an alarm.</p>

<p>On this day the men at the Bala Hissar were
put on half rations in consequence of the large
supplies of ottah required to be sent to cantonments,
and which Capt. Kirby is getting stored
as fast as he can.</p>

<p>Ammunition, by the directions of the Major-Gen.,
is now beginning to be thrown into the Bala
Hissar, under charge of Capt. Walker, commanding
detachment of 4th local horse, who has orders
to bring back all the ottah he can collect in time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
return before daylight; but, owing to the men
(who are half starved in cantonments) always, immediately
on depositing their loads, leaving their
ranks to forage for themselves, not more than
half the loads usually arrived.</p>

<p>We now began to bombard the city in earnest
from Nicholl's battery, beginning at eight o'clock
every evening and continuing until eleven, firing
at intervals of about ten minutes from the 5½-inch
mortar, and the nine-pounder. The effect
was beautiful to us in the cantonments; but it is
to be feared that was almost the only effect it
had, as, from all we could learn, four or five were
the usual average of victims, being a very small
number for so great an expenditure of ammunition.
Amenoollah Khan's house was the principal
object of attack, and one or two shells went
completely through it; but as, immediately on
the shelling commencing, he and all his family
left it for some other residence, the loss of a few
of his horses was the utmost injury he suffered.</p>

<p>Regarding Brig. Shelton's view of affairs, it
may be remarked that, from the first of his arrival
in the country, he appears to have greatly disliked
it, and his disgust has now considerably
increased. His mind is set on getting back to
Hindostan; and it is worthy of remark that from
the first, on going into the Bala Hissar, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
desired Capt. Nicholl to fill all the ammunition
boxes, as fast as it was expended, with flour (ottah),
to be ready for provision in case of retreat.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;The enemy showed themselves again on
the hills, and were permitted to remain unmolested.</p>

<p>The Envoy wished troops to be sent out; but
deference was paid to Shelton's opinion, who
would not attack them, being all for a retreat to
Hindostan.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Having bullied us with impunity yesterday,
the enemy again showed themselves on the
hills, and rushed with a shout into the village of
Behmaru, which they occupy and vacate as the
whim takes them. They also lined the Siah
Sung hills, came down to the river, and kept up
such a heavy fire, that we could not keep our
gun outside the rear gate, and we had to bring
it in.</p>

<p>The enemy are in possession of several forts
near us. The 44th and part of every corps were
out under Shelton, but considerable delay took
place, and it was only on the Envoy assuring the
General that he would take the responsibility of
the act on himself that the troops were sent out.</p>

<p>They attacked the Rikabashees' fort. By some
blunder, Bellew did not go at the gate, but blew
in the wicket. Lieut. Bird, of the Shah's 6th,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
and a few others, got in, when the enemy's cavalry
charged, and the 44th turned&mdash;"sauve qui peut."
Here Shelton proved a trump. Cool and brave,
he with much difficulty succeeded in rallying the
men, to save those inside, and when they did
return they fought like lions. It was a very
fearful affair as witnessed by nearly all in cantonments;
and the men, both Europeans and natives,
in the second attack behaved with undaunted
courage. Capt. Westmacott, 37th, had been skirmishing
in front, and commanded the advance
No. 2. and 3. companies of the 37th. On the
retreat of the troops, Lieut. Hawtrey (37th), Capt.
MacCrea (44th), Lieut. Cadett (44th), Lieut.
Bird (6th), Lieut.-Col. Mackrell (44th), and two
or three soldiers (44th), and a havildar and four
or five of the 37th, were left in the fort, having
rushed in at the kirkee (wicket). Lieuts. Hawtrey
and Cadett returned to endeavour to get more
of the men up. Bird's account of the affair is,
that when they got in they experienced a most
decided opposition, but the enemy rushing out at
the opposite gate, they took advantage of it,
when abandoned by their comrades, to close the
entrance, securing the chain with a bayonet. The
enemy, seeing the success of their own charge
outside, rallied, and, cutting a hole in the door
with their long knives, they got out the bayonet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
and opened the gate again. Bird and one Sipahee,
37th, and one or two others, retreated to a
room in which there were two horses, and
through a small opening kept up a sharp fire,
luckily killing the few who saw them enter, and
afterwards picking off all who passed in their way.
Above thirty were thus killed, fifteen of whom
fell to Bird's share, and six to that of the Sipahee
of the 37th, for which the Sipahee was afterwards
promoted, by Bird's especial request to Major
Griffith. Col. Mackrell went to the door, to look
if relief was coming, disregarding Bird's advice to
remain with him coolly and steadily till they got
reinforcements. The Colonel was wounded and
fell, and the cavalry cut him up dreadfully. He
was wounded in both legs, one below the knee,
the other on the thigh; he had three cuts in the
back, two toes cut off, and three or four cuts on
the arm, which was taken off immediately after
he was brought in. Poor man! He said, "This
is not battle, it is murder!" He still lives, but
is not likely to survive: better had he been shot
at once. To persons accustomed to civilised
warfare, these details must be revolting. Even a
dead enemy is never passed without a cut at the
body. They cry "Aman" themselves, but never
show mercy to Kaffirs.</p>

<p>Capt. MacCrea was in the fort all but one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
arm, by which they seized him and dragged him
out: his was a very similar fate, but his sufferings
were less protracted, for he was dead when found,
with, I believe, his skull cloven.</p>

<p>Poor Westmacott of the 37th was cut to pieces
near the kirkee. We must have killed a great
number of the enemy. Mr. Bird says he himself
saw above 100 killed, but that as fast as a man
fell, others came and dragged him away. Major
Scott in vain tried to rally the 44th: excited to
tears, he called for volunteers to follow him, when
a private, named Stuart, was the only man who
offered to go, and for which, on its reaching the
Envoy's notice, he was, by Sir William's earnest
entreaty to Shelton, promoted sergeant.</p>

<p>When the storming party came up the second
time under Shelton, a cruel scene took place.
The enemy could not have had less than 150
killed and wounded. We had ourselves fully
that number. There were 26 killed and 28
wounded of the 44th; above 50 killed and
wounded of the 37th. I did not hear the number
of the Shah's 6th, and have not access to records;
not that they are kept very correctly, for Sturt
was never returned as a wounded officer.</p>

<p>The conduct of the 37th is highly spoken of:
they drove the enemy (who had got on the top of
a bastion) with their bayonets clean over the side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
where they were received on the bayonets of the
44th.</p>

<p>The dreadful slaughter of our men is attributable
to a desperate rush of Affghan cavalry. It
is supposed that some very influential person was
in the fort, and has been killed. A body richly
dressed was found, but the head was carried away.
This they do when they cannot take the body,
as the head then receives Mussulman burial,
which the Affghans are very particular in observing.
A horse was taken, and a sword that
was much bent; both are said to have been
recognised as having lately been in possession
of Moollah Mobend of Zoormut. Four other
forts were taken, from which the enemy ran on
the capture of the Rikabashees'.</p>

<p>Shelton led the troops out towards the Siah
Sung hill, where the enemy was in force, and
where Eyre did great execution with two horse
artillery guns. The troops remained out till dark,
when, having completely overawed the enemy,
they returned. Three times the sappers were
ordered (and as often countermanded) for the
purpose of blowing up these forts and firing them.
At length it was decided to keep the Rikabashees'
fort, and to occupy it. There is known to be a
large store of boussa and lucern there; and
we hope also to find grain. Zulfar Khan's fort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
was also occupied by us. These forts were not
above 400 yards from cantonments. The furthest
fort is memorable as the spot where a murder was
committed not long ago, and was perhaps 1000
yards distant; of this the four bastions were
blown up, and the place itself fired. As Brig.
Shelton has always been supposed to be greatly
disliked by his men, it has excited much astonishment
that the men of the 44th were all
inquiring after the "little Brig.," as they call him.
They say they are ready to be led to any work
there may be for them to do.</p>

<p>This event has already produced its effect.
Khojeh Meer of Behmaru has sent his salaam
to know our pleasure. The Envoy's reply was,
"If you wish to keep your two forts, sell us
grain."</p>

<p>The events of to-day must have astonished the
enemy after our supineness, and shown them
that, when we have a mind to do so, we can
punish them.</p>

<p>Our spirits are raised and depressed by the
barometer of public events. Could any thing
have roused us at first to action, the insurrection
had been crushed in the bud. When the 44th
turned and fled to-day, the Gen. asked the Envoy
if he was prepared to retreat to Jellalabad as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
to-night; but Sir William replied that he would
do his duty, and never desert the King; and,
if the army left him, would die at his post!</p>

<p>Now we are uppermost we hold up our heads,
and hope not to have to sculk into the Bala
Hissar without baggage. Were Sturt's advice
taken, we should nightly send ammunition there,
and, when a sufficiency is conveyed, all make one
bold night march in very light marching order,
just what we can carry on our horses. In there,
we can be lodged (not comfortably, I grant) in
the houses of the inhabitants, who would be well
paid for vacating them. They have laid in their
stores for the winter, which would be bought at
any price&mdash;and then we might defy all Affghanistan
for any time. However it seems hopeless to
think on such subjects, for those who with a great
end in view might be brought to abandon public
works and property for a time, will not consent to
part with their own! A horse, with handsome
silver-mounted saddle, &amp;c ., has been brought in
by Lieut. Vanrenen, who sold it for 120 rupees
to some one who fancied it because it was supposed
to have belonged to a chief.</p>

<p>Sturt's recovery and energy appear little short
of miraculous; he nearly possesses the power of
ubiquity. He cannot yet mount his own tall horses,
and must astonish my little Cape horse, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
gallops him the whole day from bastion to gate, and
gate to bastion, laying guns, and off like a shot; his
aim being to show the enemy that all our batteries
and gates had guns in position, which we could
fire nearly simultaneously,&mdash;for they know how
weak we are in artillery officers.</p>

<p>The enemy kept up a smart fire for some hours;
the bullets flew about briskly, and fell plentifully
in the verandahs of Capt. Boyd's house.</p>

<p>An artilleryman was killed whilst sponging his
gun; also two bheestees in the Mission Compound.</p>

<p>Sir William told Sturt this morning that if
we beat the enemy to-day, he felt convinced
that in five days they would all be off; and the
circumstance of Khojeh Meer's salaam is a favourable
sign.</p>

<p>To-morrow early we are to endeavour to get
grain from Khojeh Meer at Behmaru.</p>

<p>The grain in the Commissariat fort is still
burning, and the fort itself still in possession
of the enemy, who annoy us from thence and
from the Shah bagh and Mahmood Khan's fort.
The latter place we are not strong enough to
take unless Sale's brigade or Nott's arrives: this
is much to be regretted, for in all disturbances in
Cabul, whichever party kept possession of that
fort was always the conqueror in the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
Gen. Nott may be here with his brigade in
three weeks: we have plenty of ammunition, and
if we can get grain we may hold out till they
arrive.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday's lesson has made the enemy
shy, and very few showed themselves on the hill,
and those were all horsemen: none were seen
on the Siah Sung hills.</p>

<p>Two regiments were sent to cover the foraging
party collecting grain from the captured forts.
600 maunds of wheat have been brought in,
boussa, &amp;c .; this gives us three and a half days'
provisions.</p>

<p>Ottah is ready for us at the Bala Hissar, and
the chief of Behmaru has tendered his civilities
again, now that Meer Musjudee's people have
retired from the village; but our 900 maunds
of grain that were paid for are gone.</p>

<p>A large grave, or rather pit, full of bodies has
been found outside the Rikabashees' fort, which
the enemy had not time to cover over before they
retreated.</p>

<p>Bad news from Candahar. A party of the Shah's
troops under Lieut. Crawford, who were escorting
state prisoners, are said to have been attacked and
cut to pieces, and it is feared that Capt. Sanders
(Engineers) was with them. Capt. Skinner is
reported to have been killed in endeavouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
to escape out of the city in women's clothes.
A dog of Col. Dennie's, and another of Major
Kershaw's, having come into cantonments, has
caused much excitement: as we have not heard
from Sale's camp for some time, we think it
may be a proof that they are on their way
back.</p>

<p>To-day we have been throwing shells into
Mahmood Khan's fort, both from the cantonments
and also from the Bala Hissar. We hear that
to-morrow night the enemy intend to take the
cantonments, and that they have fifteen ladders to
escalade with, and bags filled with boussa to cross
by filling up the ditch. Our men are all in high
spirits.</p>

<p>Meer Musjudee has sent to Sir William to say
he will come in to treat; his vakeel was in cantonments
yesterday. The Ghilzyes have been
(it is said) brought off by the Envoy. It was a
reinforcement of 1000 Ghazees that joined the
enemy yesterday at the Rikabashees' fort; it is
supposed that they suffered very severely in the
action.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Arrangements have been made by Sir
William with Meer Musjudee, who is to receive
60,000 rupees if he brings in Codrington's regiment:
he, poor man, has died of his wounds. The expected
attack on the cantonments has not taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
place, but there was a good deal of firing all
night, and shells were thrown from one o'clock at
Mahmood Khan's fort.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;The Ghilzye chiefs expressed a wish to
treat: however that may be, the enemy showed
themselves on their favourite heights (Behmaru);
they are supposed to be reinforcements from
Zoormut. They took two guns up with them,
which they played upon cantonments. On this
Brig. Shelton was sent with a force against them.
It was with great difficulty the Envoy persuaded
the General and Brigadier to consent to a force
going out; and it was late before the troops were
ready, consisting of&mdash;</p>

<p>A squadron of Anderson's horse, 120 men,
under himself:</p>

<p>The Envoy's cavalry escort, about 60 men,
under Le Geyt:</p>

<p>The 5th cavalry, all but their usual guards,
about 250, under Col. Chambers, being two
squadrons, the rest being with Sale:</p>

<p>A troop of the 1st and another of the 4th
locals, or Skinner's and Alexander's horse, under
Capt. Walker:</p>

<p>6 companies of the 44th, under Major Scott;
4 weak companies of 40, or 160 men, of the 37th;
the Shah's 6th, the 5th, I believe six companies
each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
There were three columns; two companies
of the 37th led the left column under Thain,
with the 44th in the centre and Shah's 6th in
rear. The right column was under Scott, the reserve
under Major Swayne.</p>

<p>Civilians and women are fond of honour and
glory, and perhaps do not sufficiently temper
valour with discretion.</p>

<p>It appears that the Affghans attribute our forbearance,
whatever may be its motive, to fear, which
gives them courage to beard us lions in our den.</p>

<p>The General again (as in the late attack on the
Rikabashee fort) asked the Envoy if he would
take the responsibility of sending out the troops
on himself; and, on his conceding, the force was
sent. The Envoy had also much angry discussion
on this point with Brig. Shelton.</p>

<p>But all these delays of conference lost much
time, and it was between four and five <small>P.M.</small> before
operations commenced.</p>

<p>The Affghan cavalry charged furiously down
the hill upon our troops in close column. The
37th N. I. were leading, the 44th in the centre,
and the Shah's 6th in the rear. No square
or balls were formed to receive them. All
was a regular confusion; my very heart felt as
if it leapt to my teeth when I saw the Affghans
ride clean through them. The onset was fearful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
They looked like a great cluster of bees, but we
beat them and drove them up again.</p>

<p>The 5th cavalry and Anderson's horse charged
them up the hill again and drove them along the
ridge.</p>

<p>Lieut. Eyre quickly got the horse artillery gun
into the gorge between the Behmaru hills and that
to the left (the gorge leading to the plain towards
the lake): from this position he soon cleared that
plain, which was covered with horsemen. There
was another stand made at the extreme left; but
we were successful on all points, captured both
guns, brought one of them in, for which we had
spare horses in the field; and having no means of
bringing the other away, it was spiked, upset, and
tumbled down the hill.</p>

<p>The enemy had taken these guns up the hill
with the King's elephants; but unfortunately they
had sent the animals back, or they would have
been fine prizes for us.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton, perhaps not considering the lateness
of the hour, deferred his return to cantonments
until the shades of evening had closed over
the troops; and it being impossible to distinguish
friend from foe, we could not assist with our guns
from cantonments, which in daylight would have
swept the plain, and have prevented the enemy
from following up our return to cantonments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
The enemy cut in between cantonments and
our men, and their horsemen came up close to
Sale's bastion. Our anxiety was very great, for
all this time our front was attacked (it is said by
400 men); the firing was sharp and long-continued.
The Brigadier did not get back till 8 o'clock; and
it was some time after that before all was quiet.
When the men of the 37th were upbraided for
turning, they replied, "We only retreated when we
saw the Europeans run, and knew we should not
be supported."</p>

<p>We moved into Sturt's house this evening, as
Brig. Shelton was grumbling about the cold in a
tent.</p>

<p>The enemy saluted our house with six-pound
shot, which rattled about and passed us, and several
struck the house; one was imbedded in the wall
under Mrs. Sturt's window. At night we threw
shell as usual into Mahmood Khan's fort, and
could plainly distinguish the sound of "Ullah ul
Alla" as they burst.</p>

<p>Major Thain and Capt. Paton were wounded:
the latter had to suffer amputation of the arm;
the former had a deep flesh wound in the shoulder,
twelve inches long, and one deep.</p>

<p>Sturt, going his rounds at night, narrowly escaped
being shot in the back.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;We had a quiet night; which was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
great blessing, as Sturt was suffering very much
from the wound in his face.</p>

<p>The chiefs complained that we broke faith with
them yesterday in attacking them when they had
expressed a wish to treat: however, we were not
the aggressors, for we did not do so till they had
fired at us. To-day they have requested we
will not fire on the hill, which has been agreed to:
they are (they say) busy searching for their dead.
They had lights on the hill all night, burying their
slain, and they are now searching for swords and
any thing they can find, also picking up balls of
all kinds.</p>

<p>A number of swords have been taken.</p>

<p>The two sons of Abdoollah Khan are said to
be wounded. We could hear Abdoollah Khan's
nagura beating on the hill quite distinctly.</p>

<p>Had Sale's brigade been here, it is probable we
should not be so peaceable; but our men are so
hard worked that they require a day's rest.</p>

<p>The Affghan cavalry yesterday were not
inclined to try a second charge: Col. Chambers
invited an attack, which they declined. Their
infantry seem to be contemptible in the plain,
but they fight hard when cooped up in forts.
They fire from rests; and then take excellent aim;
and are capital riflemen, hiding behind any stone
sufficiently large to cover their head, and quietly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
watching their opportunities to snipe off our people.
There is also a peculiarity in the Affghan mode
of fighting,&mdash;that of every horseman carrying a
foot soldier behind him to the scene of action,
where he is dropped without the fatigue of walking
to his post. The horsemen have two and
three matchlocks or juzails each, slung at their
backs, and are very expert in firing at the gallop.
These juzails carry much further than our
muskets.</p>

<p>The Envoy went out to meet some chiefs in
Zulficar Khan's fort: they kept him waiting a
long time, and then said they could not come.
Meer Jaffier Khan, the son of Naib Shureef, has
returned from collecting the revenue, with 300
Hazir Bashes: being all Kuzzilbashes, we presume
he will not be against us. The old Naib has
been fined 1000 rupees for having associated
with, and eaten with, us infidels.</p>

<p>Meer Musjudee is said to be sick even unto
death in the city. A cossid has arrived from
Macgregor, and a letter from Sale of the 9th
from Gundamuk. The enemy are evidently
spreading false information, through persons professing
to be travellers. No travellers are on the
roads now. Cossids are scarcely procurable; the
few that have been sent to recall the brigade have
not succeeded in their attempt. The man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
went on the 6th was stopped and his letter read by
a man who was educated at Loodianah. The
enemy have another sçavant, who imbibed literature
at the college of Delhi. There is also a
prisoner, a Mr. Tierney, in the city; whether he
assists them or not we do not know.</p>

<p>The day has passed off quietly, and we look
forward to a good night's rest, which is most
desirable for Sturt.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;After a quiet night, we have had a quiet
day.</p>

<p>Our camels are dying fast: we see several
dragged away daily; and as they are only just
thrown without the gate, the air is tainted by
their carcasses.</p>

<p>Major Pottinger and Mr. Haughton have made
their escape from the Kohistan; the former has a
ball in his leg; the latter has lost his hand, and is
severely wounded in the back and neck. During
the time they were beleaguered in Charikar, they
were, in common with the Sipahees of the Shah's
4th regiment (Ghoorkas), subjected to great misery
from the want of water; the allowance for
the last four days being one wine glass full per
diem for each man: the horses they rode on had
not had a drop to drink for ten days, nor food
for five.</p>

<p>The site of the cantonments was badly chosen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
In addition to there being no water, which of
itself rendered the site unfit for a military post,
their position was completely commanded on two
sides by the enemy; who, having cut off their supply
of water from above, gave the few defenders
no rest by night or day. Added to these trying
circumstances, the garrison were encumbered with
their wives and children, who had been encouraged
to come up from Hindostan in great numbers. It
is affirmed that they did so by permission of Lord
Auckland; it being supposed that they would
have no wish to quit the country with their families
settled along with them.</p>

<p>The not being allowed to bring up their families,
even at their own expence, was always considered
as a heavy grievance by the Europeans; but, in
their instance, the wisdom of the refusal has been
proved. But to return to the Ghoorkas; harassed
by the enemy, and encumbered by their
families, they sank into a state of perfect apathy;
not so the Punjabee artillerymen who served
the guns. Part of these deserted to the enemy;
and, on the following day, had the insolence to
return for the purpose of seducing away their
comrades. It was in trying to arrest some of
these that poor Haughton was so dreadfully
wounded: perceiving his intentions, the Jemadar
of artillery (a Punjabee) snatched Lt. Rose's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
sword from him, and with it cut off Haughton's
hand. It was with great difficulty that Pottinger
and Haughton effected their escape. Somewhere
between Akterae and Istalif during the night they
strayed from the other officers. Finding themselves
separated from the rest, they determined
to make the best of their way, secreting themselves
in a hollow during the day, and travelling all
night; but Haughton's wounds, particularly those
in the neck and back, prevented his urging his
horse beyond a walk. On arriving at Cabul,
they decided on going straight through the city
in the night; they were challenged, and Pottinger
gave a Persian reply; which the guard evidently
judged a doubtful one, as it was followed by a
volley being fired at them, but fortunately without
effect, and they pursued their way to cantonments,
arming at the gate in such a state of exhaustion
that had they had a mile further to go they never
could have sat on their horses. From them I
heard the particulars of Maule's, Rattray's, and
Wheeler's deaths. They were sitting together, I
believe at breakfast, when some of their own men
attacked them: they are said to have set their
backs against the wall and defended themselves
until they were deliberately shot.</p>

<p>The report to-day is that Abdoollah Khan's
sons are killed; that Amenoolah's two sons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
are killed, and Shumsoodeen's two brothers
wounded; the latter are nephews of the Ameer,
Dost Mahommed.</p>

<p>It is also reported that the enemy say they
cannot meet us in the field, but they will starve
us out of the country.</p>

<p>The Envoy has information that we are to be
attacked to-night on three faces of the cantonments;
this is the first night of the moon: Sturt's
Affghan servants say that, if an attack is made, it
will not be for three nights to come, as at present
they are all feasting.</p>

<p>There is a native report that a Fouj has been
seen at Seh Baba, which has been magnified into
Sale's brigade on the way up; but from letters
of the 9th, received yesterday, it is evident that
at the time they were written none of our letters
had reached them; and they were misled by
false reports industriously spread by the enemy,
in the guise of travellers.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;There was some quick firing heard
about one in the morning. The news we gather
from people who have come in from the city is,
that Nawaub Zeman Khan has paid his troops
three lakhs of rupees, at the rate of ten rupees
for each suwar and six for each foot soldier; that
they are in high glee, and say they will attack the
Chaoney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
The 25,000 men that were to do so last night
did not make their promise good.</p>

<p>Some Goorkhas that came in to-day say that
they have no information regarding Dr. Grant,
but that they saw Lt. Rose at Karabagh.</p>

<p>A report has come in from the Bala Hissar
that Sale has gone on to Jellalabad, which Brig.
Shelton told me he believed, on the principle of
"Being out of a scrape, keep so." Most people
believe the report to be a ruse of the enemy, to
shut out hope of relief coming to us. We, however,
doubt Sale's having ever received the order
to return.</p>

<p>The city seems to be much quieter, and some
ottah and grapes were brought very early this
morning to the gate to sell. The King has
written to say he wishes to offer terms to the
rebels; but Sir William says that they must first
be sent for his approbation, lest his Majesty
should offer too much.</p>

<p>A quiet night, as far as regarded hostilities,&mdash;with
plenty of rain.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;We had a gloomy day, with rain at
intervals.</p>

<p>Another report that the 1st brigade is gone on
to Jellalabad; coupled, however, with its being
only to deposit their sick in safety, and that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
force of 10,000 men have arrived there to our
assistance from Peshawer.</p>

<p>Jubbar Khan (a brother of the Dost's) has been
appointed Wuzeer to Zeman Shah Khan, who
has coined rupees in his own name.</p>

<p>This has been a good grain day: at 12 o'clock we
had got in 400 maunds, at two Cabul seers the
rupee, and otta at one. The Cabul seer is equal
to six Hindostanee seers. The Affghans continued
bringing in grain and ottah all the day.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;This morning, at 2 o'clock, an attempt
was made to throw in ammunition into the Bala
Hissar, but it failed; and Capt. Walker and Lieut.
Webb reported that the bridge, which was to
have been repaired by the Wuzeer, had not been
touched.</p>

<p>Accounts received from Jellalabad by a cossid,
who brought a letter to Sir William which he
had torn in three pieces for the better concealment
of its contents; on seeing the enemy he
swallowed another small one; he was searched,
but brought in the torn letter without discovery.
He reports, that, after Macgregor gave him the
letter, he delayed his departure a little; that
there was a grand <i>Larye</i> at Jellalabad; that Sale
had thrown his force into the fort there; that the
enemy had come down with 40,000 men, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
Sale had sallied out and beat them, pursuing the
enemy eight or ten miles to Futteabad.</p>

<p>Another report stated that Sale had been
obliged to spike three of his guns. A few hours
afterwards another courier arrived with a letter
from Sale, by which it appears that the enemy
surrounded the fort, in number about 5,000, and
that he ordered a sally under Col. Monteath, of
600 infantry, all his cavalry, and three guns.
The cavalry maintained their character, and behaved
nobly, and the enemy got severely handled.</p>

<p>My letter, containing a précis of goings-on
here from the 2d to the 8th inclusive, had
reached Sale, and was the only detail of events
that had been received; it was sent on to the
Commander-in-chief, and a copy of it to Lord
Auckland. Sale had written to Capt. Mackeson
at Peshawer for provisions, ammunition, and
troops.</p>

<p>It had been wished that this blow below should
be followed up by another here; but the council
at the General's was as usual both divided and
wild. One plan was to sally out, sword in hand,
and attack the town,&mdash;a measure that must have
been attended with great loss on our side, even if
victorious; with the pleasing certainty of all who
were left in cantonments having their throats cut
during the absence of the troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
The next proposition was the taking of Killa
Mahmood Khan. But nearly the same objection
existed there. With a large force, and much probable
loss, we might take it; but we could not
destroy it quickly, and could not afford troops to
garrison it. It is rather fortunate that the last-mentioned
attack was not made: for a few hours
afterwards we had certain information that, instead
of 200 men, the enemy have nearly all
their infantry there.</p>

<p>A report was this day brought to the King
that the Jemadar of Juzailchees, who commanded
at the Upper Town, above the Bala Hissar, had
deserted his post during the night, accompanied
by two non-commissioned officers of his guard.
His Majesty was extremely wroth; and ordered
all the men to be relieved, and another party,
consisting of Rohillas from the Peshawer territory,
to be sent in their place. Most fortunate
was the discovery, and the prompt measures taken
on the occasion; as it was discovered, from secret
information sent in by Mohun Lull during the
day, that the traitor had sold the tower to the
rebel Sirdars for a hundred gold mohurs. This
man had the effrontery to return in the evening;
and declare, with the greatest <i>sang froid</i>, that he
had only been away on his own business into the
city; and angrily demanded why he was deprived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
of his command. He was, however, put in irons,
and confined in the fort prison.</p>

<p>Mohun Lull's account stated that arrangements
had been made to give up the tower that same
night to a party who were to come round by the
back of the hill. Had this plot succeeded, the
Bala Hissar might have been taken, as the tower
commands it.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;At two in the morning an alarm; which
soon died away. Shortly after this the ammunition
was sent off to the Bala Hissar, under
charge of Col. Oliver; who sent back to report
that in consequence of the bridge being out of
repair, and there being water in the Nullah, he
could not proceed, and desired instructions how
to act. The reply from the General was, if he
could not proceed, he was to return: when this
arrived, Oliver had got over with the ammunition;
but I suppose he misunderstood the order, for he
recrossed and came back again. With very few
exceptions the 5th N. I. may be said to be inefficient
from the commanding officers to the
lowest rank.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we got in a good deal
of grain; but the General appears to be kept in a
deplorable state of ignorance. Although reports
are sent in daily, he scarcely knows what supplies
are in store, or what is our real daily consumption.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
Affairs are curiously carried on: for instance,
the Shah's 6th indent for six maunds
daily; the 37th, a much weaker corps, for about
twenty! These indents are all signed by authority!
The quantity required is easily calculated, as each
fighting man gets a half seer of wheat, and each
camp follower six chattaks per diem. There is
much roguery going on in the regimental bazaars,
where the Chowdrys make money in connexion
with the Bunneahs.</p>

<p>They say the 6th have a full bazaar from loot
at the forts taken lately, and do not require to
draw for their followers: the 37th have 5,000
registered camp followers, and other corps much
in the same proportions.</p>

<p>The Affghans are highly indignant at Pottinger
and Haughton having ridden through the town.
It certainly appears to us very wonderful that
they did so in safety.</p>

<p>There was some firing in the city about sunset,&mdash;both
guns and volleys of musketry. The
rebel chiefs are supposed to have attacked the
Kuzzilbashes in the vicinity of Morad Khana.</p>

<p>The enemy have sent to the Kohistan for the
guns that are at Charikar, and on their arrival
propose giving us battle. A plan was laid to
sally out from the Bala Hissar towards the city,
and destroy an Hamaum exactly in front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
Ghuznee gate. In this place reside a barber and
a blacksmith, two of the best shots in Cabul, who
have picked off many of our men. They completely
commanded the loopholes with their long
rifles; and although the distance is probably 300
yards, yet they seldom fail to put a ball through
the clothes or into the body of any one passing
them. It was sufficient for the loophole to be
darkened, for it to be fired at; and it became an
amusement to place a cap on the end of a pole
above the walls, which was sure to be quickly
perforated by many balls.</p>

<p>I believe this plan was never put in execution,
and only, like many others, proved a source of
speculation and conversation.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;The firing in the city yesterday was
consequent upon some persons having taken refuge
with the Kuzzilbashes, who refused to give
them up, as being contrary to the Affghan rules
of hospitality. There has been more fighting
amongst themselves to-day.</p>

<p>The latest report is that the Ghilzyes, and
Kohistanees, and all the people who come from
a distance, are anxious to return to their own
homes, finding that there is no more plunder to
be had, and sundry hard knocks being all that they
are likely to obtain. However, they have been
requested to stay for a few days, just to see how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
the Chaoney is taken when the guns arrive from
the Kohistan. These same guns cannot be very
formidable, for they are said to have been spiked
at Charikar; and, moreover, the carriages are
broken down&mdash;all split at the elevating screw.</p>

<p>The enemy are now talking of pitching camps
on the other side of the hills towards the Lake,
and also on the Siah Sung encamping ground.</p>

<p>There was a report to-day that a large force
was coming in with the guns, for which the
rebels have sent the King's elephants. In consequence
of this report, and another that the enemy
had taken possession of a fort in our rear, six
companies of infantry and two troops of horse
were sent out, but only a few stragglers were to
be seen; and the forts were all peaceably occupied
by women and children as usual.</p>

<p>Camels and tattoos are dying fast, and the air
is most unpleasantly scented at times.</p>

<p>It is now rumoured that the reason Sale's brigade
does not come up is, that the two regiments
refuse to do so. This I do not believe; they may
have been annoyed at the thoughts of returning;
but I will never believe they refuse to aid us in
our extremity, if they have the power to do so:
and I consider the report to be of a piece with
Brig. Shelton's expression that Sale's brigade was
safe, and would keep so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
Nooreddin Khan (the chief of the Jan Baz,
who so nimbly have found their way to Cabul),
was the son of an old servant of Shah Shoojah's.
In consequence of the father having been faithful
to him through his misfortunes, the King was
anxious to provide for the son, and gave him the
command of the Jan Baz. On Nooreddin's arrival,
Conolly sent him a message reproaching him
for the ingratitude of his conduct, to which
the young scamp replied, that all he could promise
in our favour was a safe retreat from the
country!</p>

<p>The Ghoorka corps is said to be entirely cut
up, and we have no longer any hopes of Rose's
or Grant's escape. The men are said to have
been disgusted at having persons placed over them
as native officers, who were raised at the same
time as themselves, and who were not of higher
caste.</p>

<p>We have as yet no news from Candahar, from
whence we expect to hear of a similar rising to
that here.</p>

<p>Walker succeeded in throwing in ammunition
into the Bala Hissar early this morning, as also
30,000 rupees, each horseman carrying a small
bag of coin.</p>

<p>To-day part of the ammunition was removed
into Westmacott's house; some put under sheds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
and the rest was left in the square: it seems
there was fear of its being blown up by the
enemy!</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The enemy uncommonly quiet; said to
be employed in manufacturing powder and shot,
and hammering such of our shot as they pick up
to fit their guns.</p>

<p>Some servants of Skinner's have gone to the
Bala Hissar to Conolly; they report that their
master is still safe in the city. Capt. Drummond
is under Zeman Shah Khan's protection.</p>

<p>Shumsuddeen Khan is said to be dying of his
wounds.</p>

<p>At dinner time Brig. Shelton sent to Mr. Eyre,
stating that the Envoy had information that
80,000 foot and 10,000 horse were coming to set
fire to our magazine with red-hot balls! How
these balls were to be conveyed here red hot is a
mystery, as the enemy have no battery to erect
furnaces in: but nothing is too ridiculous to be
believed; and really any horrible story would be
sure to be credited by our panic-struck garrison.</p>

<p>It is more than shocking, it is shameful, to hear
the way that officers go on croaking before the
men: it is sufficient to dispirit them, and prevent
their fighting for us.</p>

<p>There is said to be a kind of republican council
in the city, composed of twelve chiefs, to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
the people at present pay obedience. I wonder
what the new King, Zeman Shah Khan, and his
Wuzeer think of this new power.</p>

<p>A man of Warburton's artillery has deserted, as
also a havildar of Hoskins' regiment; the latter
was received by Zeman Shah Khan with great
honour, and told that all good Mussulmans were
welcome. A house and shawls were given to
him.</p>

<p>Our useless expenditure of ammunition is ridiculous.
At the captured fort last night the
garrison popped away 350 rounds at shadows, probably
of themselves: however, we have plenty of
it; 13 lakhs made up, and 900 barrels of powder,
shot, bullets, &amp;c . in store in profusion.</p>

<p>Shelton croaks about a retreat; and so much is
openly said of our extremity, that were we obliged
to fall back on Jellalabad, it is more than probable
that there would be much desertion amongst the
Mussulmans.</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascribe the just cause to the inactivity
of the enemy: if they feared us, they
would disperse; and if they mean to starve us,
why do they allow us to get in supplies in the
quantities they do? That something is in agitation
there can be no doubt; and the most plausible
idea is, that the enemy think that by keeping us
on the alert so long for nothing, that we shall all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
relax in our vigilance, and give them the opportunity
to attack the cantonments with success.</p>

<p>Sturt has in vain suggested that a picket of infantry
and cavalry with a couple of guns be sent
at daybreak up the hill towards Siah Sung, to
cut off the supplies we see daily going into the
town.</p>

<p>By purchasing them, we might induce the people
to supply us largely, and at all events prevent
the enemy obtaining them. I have no patience
with those who say, "Oh, it is not ottah, it is only
charcoal." Now our foes require charcoal as much
as we do food, for they cannot make their gunpowder
without it; and wood is very scarce in
the city, for the poor people who used to bring it
in on donkeys have ceased to do so, lest it should
be taken for nothing.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;At two o'clock this morning Walker
took the bedding for the artillery to the Bala
Hissar.</p>

<p>This being considered a propitious day, the
enemy lined the heights towards the lake. A
party was sent to occupy the friendly village of
Behmaru; but, as usual, delay was the order of
the day, and it was deferred until the enemy had
taken possession, though not in great force.</p>

<p>On the troops arriving there under Major
Swayne, of the 5th, the enemy evacuated it: he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
instead of allowing the men (as they themselves
wished) to enter the village, kept them under
hedges firing pot shots, on which the enemy reoccupied
the position. The force sent out was 1
horse artillery gun, 1 mountain train ditto, 1
ressalah of Anderson's horse, 1 ditto Walker's,
1 ditto 5th cavalry, 400 5th N. I.; the whole
under Major Swayne, 5th N. I. In the evening
a reinforcement was sent of the remainder of the
5th, under Col. Oliver. Lieut. Eyre wounded
severely in the hand. The troops returned, having
done nothing.</p>

<p>The Ghilzye chiefs say they have sworn on the
Koran to fight against us; and so they must
fight, but that they will not fight hard. This is
what they have told Sir William through their
emissaries. He is trying to treat with all parties:
but the sanctity of an oath is evidently but little
regarded; and what faith can we put in their
assertions?</p>

<p>We have just heard that Capt. Woodburn, with
130 men, returning to India, was enticed into a
fort at Shekoabad, a few marches on this side of
Ghuznee, where they swore on the Koran to be
our friends, and where the whole party were massacred.
Poor Woodburn was represented as a
strong man, who took four or five Golees to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
him! There is a report to-day that two regiments
coming from Candahar have been cut up.</p>

<p>Grand dissensions in military councils. High
and very plain language has been this day used by
Brig. Shelton to Gen. Elphinstone; and people do
not hesitate to say that our chief should be set
aside&mdash;a mode of proceeding recommended a
fortnight ago by Mr. Baness, the merchant.</p>

<p>The poor General's mind is distracted by the
diversity of opinions offered; and the great bodily
ailments he sustains are daily enfeebling the powers
of his mind. He has lost two of his best advisers
in Paton and Thain; the former confined
by his wound, the latter declining to offer advice,
from disgust at its being generally overruled, by
the counsel of the last speaker being acted on.</p>

<p>There is much reprehensible croaking going on;
talk of retreat, and consequent desertion of our
Mussulman troops, and the confusion likely to take
place consequent thereon. All this makes a bad
impression on the men. Our soldiery like to see
the officers bear their part in privation; it makes
them more cheerful; but in going the rounds at
night, officers are seldom found with the men.
There are those that always stay at their
posts on the ramparts, and the men appreciate
them as they deserve. To particularise them
would be too openly marking the rest; but their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
names will, I trust, be remembered to their honour
and advantage hereafter. Amongst these,
Capt. Bygrave, the Paymaster-General, was conspicuous:
he never slept away from his post (the
battery near his house) for a single night, and took
his full share of fatigue, without adverting to his
staff appointment.</p>

<p>Col. Oliver is one of the great croakers. On
being told by some men of his corps, with great
<i>jee</i>, that a certain quantity of grain had been
brought in, he replied, "It was needless, for they
would never live to eat it." Whatever we think
ourselves, it is best to put a good face on the
business.</p>

<p>The enemy are erecting sungahs on the heights
above Behmaru.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;We had firing of one sort or other all
night. From the Bala Hissar they were shelling
the city, and there was much firing from our ramparts.</p>

<p>At about two in the morning, in consequence of
a resolution arrived at the preceding evening to
submit no longer to the insults of the enemy, (who
by occupying Behmaru greatly annoyed our foraging
parties, and almost precluded our attempting
to drive them off the hill immediately above
that village, whither they were accustomed to resort
in great numbers for the purpose of bravado,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
and also probably to prove our strength or weakness,)
Brig. Shelton marched out of cantonments
with seventeen weak companies: I believe many
of them did not muster above forty men. Those
from the 44th were under the command of Major
Swayne of the 5th N. I.; those from the 37th
and Shah's 6th, under Major Kershaw of the
13th. All the 5th were employed under their
own colonel (Oliver). One squadron of regular
cavalry, and two detachments of irregular horse;
one six-pound gun under Sergt. Mulhall, and
100 sappers and miners under Lieut. Laing.</p>

<p>This force ascended the hill immediately above
Behmaru, dragging the gun with them with great
difficulty, and thence up on the knoll overhanging
the village. From hence they perceived that the
village was in the possession of the enemy, who
were discernible as they slept around their watchfires.
A few rounds of grape from the gun
quickly aroused them; and they sought cover in
the houses and towers, from which they replied to
our cannonade and musketry by a sharp and pretty
well-sustained fire of juzails. Both officers and
men were most anxious to be led against the village,
to take it by storm, but the Brigadier would
not hear of it; and our men were helplessly exposed
to the fire from behind the walls, which the enemy
quickly loopholed for that purpose. After waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
until day dawned, and losing the opportunity
of taking the enemy by surprise, a party was
ordered under Major Swayne of the 5th, who,
instead of at once leading his men through the
principal entrance into the village, went to a small
kirkee, which he reported himself unable to force,
though this was afterwards done by a few men
pulling it down with their hands and kicking at
it; and after remaining there a considerable time
came back, having lost several of his men killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy (as daylight dawned) were seen
leaving the village in small parties: to cut these
off, Walker was sent down to the plain, on the
north-west side of the hill leading to the lake, with
his irregular horse. At this time large bodies of
the enemy were descried ascending the hill, near
the road by which they used to issue from the city,
and separated from that occupied by our troops
only by a narrow gorge leading to the plain and
lake beyond. To meet and oppose these, Brig.
Shelton, leaving three companies of the 37th, under
Major Kershaw, to maintain their original
position, marched the remainder of the force along
the ridge towards the gorge, taking with him also
his solitary gun!</p>

<p>I had taken up my post of observation, as usual,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
on the top of the house, whence I had a fine view
of the field of action, and where, by keeping behind
the chimneys, I escaped the bullets that continually
whizzed past me. Brig. Shelton having
brought forward skirmishers to the brow of the
hill, formed the remainder of his infantry into two
squares, the one about 200 yards in rear of the
other, the intervening space being crammed with
our cavalry, who, from the nature of the ground,
were exposed to the full fire of the enemy without
being able to act themselves.</p>

<p>The number of the enemy's foot men must have
been upwards of 10,000 (some say 15,000), and
the plain, on the N.W. of the hills, was swept by
not less than 3000 or 4000 Affghan cavalry, whose
rapid advance obliged Lieut. Walker to retreat up
the hill, by which the enemy were enabled to
throw fresh reinforcements and ammunition into
the village of Behmaru; a circumstance which
rendered it difficult for him to hold his ground.</p>

<p>The fight continued till about 10 o'clock, by
which time our killed and wounded became very
numerous. In spite of the execution done by our
shrapnell, the fire of the enemy told considerably
more than ours did, from the superiority of their
juzails and jingals over our muskets.</p>

<p>They also fought from behind sungahs and hillocks,
whilst our men were perfectly exposed; our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
troops also labouring under the disadvantage of
being drawn up in square, from an apprehension
of an attack from the Affghan cavalry.</p>

<p>The vent of the gun became too hot for the artillerymen
to serve it.</p>

<p>At this time, that is at about half-past 9 or 10,
a party of Ghazeeas ascended the brow of the hill,
by the gorge, where they planted three standards
close to each other, a red, a yellow, and a green one.
It is possible that the Brigadier might not have seen
their advance; but when they had nearly attained
the summit, they had an evident advantage over
us, as their shots generally told in firing up at our
men, whose persons were wholly exposed, whilst
only a few of their heads were visible to our
troops, and the old fault of firing too high most
probably sent all our shots harmlessly over their
heads, for to hit them it was requisite to fire on
the ground. When they fairly appeared aboveground,
it was very evident that our men were not
inclined to meet them. Every field-glass was now
pointed to the hill with intense anxiety by us in
cantonments, and we saw the officers urging their
men to advance on the enemy. Most conspicuous
were Mackintosh, Laing, Troup, Mackenzie,
and Layton; who, to encourage the men, pelted
the Ghazeeas with stones as they climbed the
hill; and, to do the fanatics justice, they returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
the assault with the same weapons. Nothing
would do,&mdash;our men would not advance, though
this party did not appear to be 150 in number. At
length one of the Ghazeeas rushed forward, waving
his sword over his head: a Sipahee of the
37th darted forth and met him with his bayonet;
but instead of a straight charge he gave him a
kind of side stroke with it, and they both fell,
and both rose again. Both were killed eventually;
the Ghazeea was shot by another man. It was
very like the scenes depicted in the battles of the
Crusaders. The enemy rushed on: drove our men
before them very like a flock of sheep with a wolf
at their heels. They captured our gun. The
artillerymen fought like heroes; two were killed
at the gun; Sergeant Mulhall received three
wounds; poor Laing was shot whilst waving his
sword over the gun and cheering the men. It
was an anxious sight, and made our hearts beat:
it lasted but for a few minutes.</p>

<p>(Brig. Shelton says, that when our men ran,
he ordered the halt to be sounded, at which the
troops mechanically arrested their flight, and fell
into their places!)</p>

<p>They ran till they gained the second square
which had not broken; and the men finding a
stand, turned about, gave a shout, and then the
Ghazeeas were, in their turn, panic-struck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
abandoned the gun, but made off with the limber
and horses.</p>

<p>On this we retook the gun without resistance.
One of the artillerymen had a wonderful escape;
he had clung on to, and under the wheels, and
never quitted it. Once more in our possession,
the gun was instantly re-opened on the
enemy; but our men had an antipathy to the
brow of the hill, and would not advance as quickly
as they might have done, until some successful
shots from the gun, and three splendid ones which
were made by Serjeant Wade from the Kohistan
Gate; one of which struck Abdoollah Khan's
horse, and caused him to fall off, on which the
people surrounded their chief, and were occupied
in carrying him off; they fled to the other hill,
and I believe never stopped until they got into
the city. All appearing to be over, I hastened
home to get breakfast ready for Sturt, every one
supposing that the enemy were routed, and that
Brig. Shelton was coming back with the troops.</p>

<p>At this time I was standing on the ramparts,
and heard the Envoy, in my presence, ask the
General to pursue the flying troops into the city,
which he refused, saying it was a wild scheme, and
not feasible.</p>

<p>Had Shelton returned to cantonments, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
thrown his force into Behmaru, all had gone well,
and we had remained masters of the field.</p>

<p>The enemy had, as I before mentioned, a large
body of cavalry on the other side of the hill, on
whom our men kept firing.</p>

<p>At about half past twelve, just as we had finished
our breakfast, the enemy gradually came up the
hill; and their fire was so severe that our men in
square could scarcely fill up the gaps as their
comrades fell, and our whole force, both horse
and foot, were driven down the hill, and our gun
captured&mdash;a regular case of <i>sauve qui peut</i>.</p>

<p>All would have been sacrificed but for four circumstances;
first, a well-directed fire kept up
from the Mission Compound by part of the Shah's
6th. A charge made by Lieut. Hardyman, with
a fresh troop of the 5th Cavalry, being joined in it
by Walker, who had collected about twenty of his
Irregulars. It was in going too far across the
plain, in driving the Affghan horse back towards
the hills, that poor Walker received his mortal
wound in the abdomen. Major Swayne was
wounded in the neck while in the square. A
party of about fifty of Mackenzie's Juzailchees,
under Capt. Trevor, lined some low walls on the
plain in front of and to the left of the old Musjeed,
whence they kept up a steady discharge.
Two of these men, seeing a wounded Sipahee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
wave his arm for help, gallantly dashed into the
midst of the enemy, and brought him off.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest safeguard of our troops
was the conduct of Osman Khan, who suddenly
stopped the pursuit and led his men back.</p>

<p>Perceiving our defeat on the hill, the troops at the
captured fort and those at the Musjeed deserted
their posts, and were with difficulty persuaded to go
back to them. The troops all scuttled back as hard
as they could. The General went outside the gate
(and took great credit to himself for doing so) to
rally them, as he called it; but there was little
chance of doing that while they were under our
walls. I was amused at hearing him say to Sir
William, "Why, Lord, sir, when I said to them
'Eyes right,' they all looked the other way."</p>

<p>Our friends in the Bala Hissar did not tamely
look on. Conolly got the King to order eight of
his suwars to go and give information to Sir
William of their having observed a body of 5000
men passing round to the back of Behmaru; and
afterwards his Majesty ordered the whole of the
Ressallahs and 100 Juzailchees to go on to the
Siah Sung hill, and try and create a diversion in
our favour by drawing away some of the troops
who were engaged with ours on the Behmaru hill.
It certainly had some effect; for immediately on
their forming on the summit, a large body of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
under Mahommed Shah Khan, a principal Ghilzye
chief, sallied out from Mahmood Khan's fort, and
advanced to the attack, which now, however, they
were not imprudent enough to await, but immediately
took to flight. By desire of the Wuzeer,
Lieut. Melville was then sent out with a party of
Juzailchees, and five sections of N. I., to keep a
body of them in check who had boldly advanced
within gunshot of the Bala Hissar: but after a
little skirmishing the enemy retired to the Siah
Sung hill.</p>

<p>The Affghans appear to have but one plan of
attack. They go up the further hill to the extreme
left near the city, and spread along the ridge, and
the horsemen conduct the infantry to the gorge.
The horsemen then some of them come up with
the infantry to the brow of the right hill, the larger
body of horse going behind it; this they did the
second time in one day.</p>

<p>Shelton, in taking up his position as before
described, had both his flanks exposed, as also his
rear. The men were formed in two large squares
when attacked by infantry, and in these squares
were men of different regiments all mixed up together:
they had never been practised to it: no man
knew his place.</p>

<p>Whilst in this square a reward of ten rupees
was offered by the Brigadier to the first man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
volunteered to go with him to take the enemy's
flag in the gorge; Captain Mackenzie shouted 100
for the flag. After some hesitation, a havildar of
the 37th came forward; but as no other followed
him, he was told to return to his place. The enemy
then came on, and the whole square rose simultaneously
and ran. The 44th had, I believe, fifty-eight
wounded; the loss of the 5th I did not ascertain;
the 37th had eighty killed, and ten wounded.
Of officers, Col. Oliver, Capt. Mackintosh, and
Lieut. Long were killed; Walker mortally
wounded; Swinton, Evans, Major Swayne, Hawtrey,
Bott, and Mackenzie wounded.</p>

<p>The three companies of the 37th that were out
under Major Kershaw suffered severely: they were
amongst the last to leave the hill. The grenadier
company returned with only a Naick and two
men!</p>

<p>The misfortunes of the day are mainly attributable
to Shelton's bad generalship in taking up so
unfavourable a position, after his first fault in neglecting
to surprise the village, and occupy it, which
was the ostensible object of the force going out.</p>

<p>Had he remained above Behmaru, he might have
retreated into and occupied that place, in which
the enemy had but few men at first, and who
might have been easily dislodged. Shelton tries
to lay all the blame on the Sipahees. He says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
they are timid, and that makes the Europeans timid
also; but he has been told some home truths. On
asking Capt. Troup if he did not think that the
44th had behaved nobly, that officer plainly told
him he considered that all had behaved shamefully.</p>

<p>The troops certainly were wearied out; and,
having been out since two in the morning, it
appears wonderful to me that at half-past twelve
they were not too weary to run; however, they
had one great inducement to do so. Osman
Khan was heard by our Sipahees to order his
men not to fire on those who ran, but to spare
them. A chief, probably the same, rode round
Kershaw three times, when he was compelled to
run with his men; he waved his sword over his
head, but never attempted to kill him; and Capt.
Trevor says his life was several times in the
power of the enemy, but he also was spared.</p>

<p>Another great fault committed was in taking
only one gun; a second would have supported the
first: with only one, as soon as it was fired the
enemy could rush upon it; as they did.</p>

<p>The enemy assembled on the Siah Sung hill,
and attacked eighty horsemen sent in with letters
by the King; they proved to be from Jellalabad.
Our people at first fired on the sikhs, but fortunately
did no harm. The enemy's cavalry then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
came down the Siah Sung hill, and escorted their
infantry into the forts beyond the river, which we
had dismantled a few days since. Our troops were
in by two o'clock; before five, not an enemy was
to be seen, and our people were out searching for
the dead. The magazine being dropt within range
of our guns was safe, and has been brought in.
Abdoollah Khan is supposed to have been killed.
No particular news from Jellalabad, where all
was going on well. There was no letter for me;
but Lawrence came to tell me that Sale was well,
and busy getting in provisions.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;A letter has come in, supposed to be a
forged seal, from Zeman Shah Khan: it has been
cautiously and courteously replied to.</p>

<p>A person has come in from Osman Khan (who
is a nephew of the Ameer Dost Mahommed) and
Shumshir deen Khan, offering us terms: they
propose that we should leave the country, giving
hostages that we will send the Dost back to them.
They say they do not wish to harm us, if we will
only go away; but that go we must, and give them
back the Dost; that Mahommed Akbar Khan
(his son) will be here to-morrow with 6000 men;
and that if we do not come to terms, they will
carry the cantonment; and that they are ready to
sacrifice 6000 men to do so.</p>

<p>What Sir William and the General's council of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
war (Shelton, Anquetil, and Chambers) mean to
do we know not; but our situation is far from
pleasant.</p>

<p>Gen. Elphinstone has written to the Envoy to-day;
requesting him to negotiate with the enemy,
in consequence of the impossibility of our going to
the Bala Hissar, and Shelton concurs in opinion
that we cannot fight our way in: also stating
we have upwards of 700 sick, and the scarcity
of provisions.</p>

<p>Last night an attempt was made to dismantle
the bridge leading towards Siah Sung, which succeeded
partly: it is now made a flying bridge.</p>

<p>Sturt proposed to destroy the Rikabashees'
fort, and throw a party that was in it into the
small fort near the bridge; but it was disapproved
by the Envoy, who said he would place a moollah
he had confidence in, in it, as the General said he
could not afford twenty men to garrison it.</p>

<p>A boy of the Syce order, who had been a prisoner
twenty days, has made his escape from the
city. He tells us, that Amenoollah Khan of
Logur is the chief who was killed by a grape-shot
in the head yesterday.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan has directed, that
when the cantonments are taken, the officers, their
wives and families, are to be made prisoners,
as hostages for his father. If once in his power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
we might be safe; but these Ghazeeas are fanatics,
and would cut us into mince-meat.</p>

<p>Poor Oliver's head and one hand were cut off
when his body was found: the latter was probably
done to obtain a diamond ring which he
always wore. The heads of all the Europeans
were taken away, and will no doubt be exhibited
as trophies!</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;The Big-wigs are angry at any thing
having transpired regarding the letters that have
come in from the chiefs; and say it is all a mistake.
Be that as it may, a guard of honour was
turned out, on the arrival of two men who refused
to parley with Lawrence and Trevor, and said
they must see the Envoy and the General. At
first they were said to be Zeman Shah Khan and
Osman Khan; then Jubhar Khan; and at last it
proved to be Sultan Khan and his private meerza.
They held their conference with the Envoy in the
officer's guard-room of the rear gateway.</p>

<p>The new king, Zeman Shah Khan, has written
to the Envoy to say that he has accepted the
throne, not from his own wish, but to prevent
greater ills arising.</p>

<p>There was a very long and unsatisfactory conference
with the ambassador. He and his secretary
rode sorry yaboos, and were only attended by
their saces. If their array was thus humble,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
their demands were sufficiently exorbitant; and
the terms they offered such as could not be accepted,
even by persons in our condition. They
require that Shah Shoojah be given up to them,
with his family; demand all our guns and ammunition;
and that Gen. Sale's force should move
to Peshawer before we march from this place.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan has arrived: we heard
the firing in honour of his arrival in the city. He
is reported to have brought in an accession of
6000 men to the force, which was before estimated
at 10,000 horse and 15,000 foot. The new
arrivals are probably Uzbeks, and not far removed
from rabble; but even a mob may from
numbers succeed against us.</p>

<p>The subadar of the native artillery has gone
off, as also three of Skinner's horse: these men
are all said to have families in the city.</p>

<p>&#363; was a great crowd of
Affghans; some hundreds of them, all armed to the
teeth, round the cantonments. They came in the
most friendly manner, saying all was settled,
<i>jung-i-kal&#363;s</i>. The men of the 44th went out of
cantonments amongst them unarmed, were shaking
hands with them, and receiving cabbages from
them, unchecked by Lieut. Cadett, the officer on
duty on that face, who seemed to think this
friendly meeting a very fine affair: however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
the circumstance got reported, and the adjutant
got the men in.</p>

<p>This appears very like a ruse on the part of the
enemy, to throw us off our guard, and surprise
us. It was suggested to the adjutant to examine
the cabbages; as it was possible that outer leaves
might cover bladders of spirits; and that, having
intoxicated the men, they would when they were
drugged make an attack on us: however, nothing
suspicious was discovered.</p>

<p>We saw a fire on the hill this evening, supposed
to be a party watching our movements,
towards the Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the enemy have
spies in cantonments; and there are so many
Affghan servants, that it is perhaps difficult to
prevent their passing in and out.</p>

<p>Two men of suspicious appearance were prowling
about the Envoy's tent, and Lawrence desired
a chuprassy not to molest them, but quietly to
dodge them, and to report progress. This he
did, and stated that the men walked all over the
cantonment, looked at every thing, and then
walked out at the gate! So much for surveillance.</p>

<p>It is now said that Abdoollah Khan was
wounded by a grape shot on the 23d, and that
there is no truth in the report of Amenoollah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
Khan, of Logur, having been stabbed in a dispute
in the council regarding terms to the Feringhees.</p>

<p>Poor Walker was buried to-day. He died of
his wound last night. He is greatly regretted
from his amiability; and, as a right gallant soldier,
his loss is doubly felt in the present crisis.</p>

<p>The Shah Razee (Moyen oo deen's father) commanded
the troops in Behmaru. He says, had
we taken possession of the village in the outset,
the day would have been ours on the 23d. We
have also heard that so great was the alarm in
Cabul, when the Affghans fled on Abdoollah
Khan's being wounded, that the women were
sent away out of the city in great numbers; and
many in such haste, that they did not even wait
to mount them on yaboos, but sent them away on
foot, expecting to see our troops in the city immediately.</p>

<p>Great care is taken of the firewood in store in
cantonments, and much discontent prevails because
fires are not allowed. The Hindostanees
feel the severity of the weather, to which they
are exposed night and day; and the want of fuel
adds much misery to their privations in being put
on short allowance of food. There is at this time
a complete winter stock of firing laid in; added
to which, on emergency, the trees of the orchard
might be cut down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
Capt. Sturt was urgent, both with Gen. Elphinstone
and Brig. Shelton, that the men might
have fires at night to enable them to warm themselves
and dry their frosted clothes when coming
off duty: but no order was given in consequence
of his suggestions.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;Negotiations with the enemy broken
off.</p>

<p>Accounts received from Sale up to the 21st;
from Macgregor to the 23d. The Khyberries up.
Capt. Fenis and his family had fled, and got safe
to Peshawer. Lieut. Mackeson was still in Alimusjid
in rather a critical position. To-day the
Affghans lined the hills; some thousands of them,
with many horsemen. They afterwards came
down to the plain, and we expected an attack
upon the cantonments. On their nearer approach,
they were found to be mostly unarmed;
some had sticks, some sticks with a knife tied
on the end of them: they were merely the shopkeepers,
come out to look at us. The Affghan
knife is a very formidable weapon, about two
feet long, and thicker, stronger, and broader than
a sword, and as sharp as possible.</p>

<p>Some of these men went up to the breach of the
captured fort, and asked, as the <i>jung</i> was over,
if they might not return, and live there. And
on being told, "No," they said, "Very well; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
will go away to-day, and come again to-morrow,
and see if we may come then."</p>

<p>One well-dressed man inquired if the volunteer
regiment (37th) was there; and being replied
to in the affirmative, said, "I want my horse
back that I lost the other day; have I any chance
of getting it?"</p>

<p>All this coming close to our works, and spying,
ought to have been stopped.</p>

<p>Sturt called out to them in Persian, and
warned them off, or he would open the guns upon
them. Some respectable people begged, for God's
sake, he would not do so; for they were not
warriors, but had come out to see sights and
amuse themselves.</p>

<p>Sturt saw a man meanly dressed on foot stealing
up close to the walls, and called out "<i>P&#275;sh
Burr&#333;;</i>" on which he raised his hand, telescope
fashion, to his eye, and showed the end of a note.
He was passed on to the gate, and admitted into
cantonments; and was said to be the bearer of a
letter from Mahommed Akbar Khan. However,
this is denied, or even that any letter came.</p>

<p>Whenever the political horizon clears a little,
mystery becomes the order of the day. "Out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh;"
and when overwhelmed with perplexity, the directors
of events here are not so close. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
events do transpire, and we know that treaties are
on foot with the Ghilzye chiefs; though that too
is denied to-day.</p>

<p>Meer Musjudee is dead. Some say he has been
poisoned; others that he died in consequence of
the wounds he received last year in the Kohistan.
A number of this chief's followers have gone off
with the body to the Kohistan, there to attend
his funeral obsequies.</p>

<p>A report has come to us through the enemy,
that three regiments, from Kandahar, have got
beyond Ghuznee, somewhere about Shecoabad;
that there has been an engagement; and that
though the Affghans could not conquer them, they
still have been able to prevent their progress.</p>

<p>Sleet in the morning; and in the afternoon
snow, which soon froze.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;We had a quiet night; and it continued
tranquil till the middle of this day; when the
horsemen again took post on the hills, and escorted
infantry to the right, and down into the village of
Behmaru, into which we threw some shells.</p>

<p>The negotiations are now come quite to a close.
The enemy's demands were modest, considering that
they were the first to treat, it is said. They require,
in addition to giving up the King and his
family into their hands, all our guns and ammunition,
muskets, bayonets, pistols, and swords.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
The married men, women, and children, to be
given as hostages; and then&mdash;we are to trust to
their generosity! To this the Envoy sent a chivalrous
reply,&mdash;That death was preferable to
dishonour,&mdash;that we put our trust in the God of
battles, and in His name bade them come on.</p>

<p>The King is in an awful state of alarm; for he
has been told that we have been making terms for
our free exit out of the country, paying for the
same five lakhs of rupees; and leaving him to his
fate, poor man! He is certainly to be pitied (if
not at the bottom of it all), fallen from his high
estate, and believing us to have abandoned him.</p>

<p>Jan Fishan Khan is the only chief who stands
by him; and he has had his forts and property
destroyed: his wives and children, he hopes, may
have been saved by some of his neighbours; but,
as yet, he only knows the fate of one young boy,
who was burnt alive. He had one wife with him
in Cabul when the insurrection broke out, and
urged her to fly to Pughman for safety; the old
chief told me, her reply was worth a lakh of
rupees, "I will not leave you; if you fall, we die
together; and if you are victorious, we will rejoice
together!"</p>

<p>Some say that Mahommed Akbar Khan is now
King, and Zeman Shah Khan his Wuzeer: others
state that the latter refuses to give up his lately
acquired power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
Ishmatoolah (the Akhoonzada or old moollah
from Kandahar, who was to have gone with
Sir William to Bombay), has taken himself off,
leaving a message for the Envoy to say that he
was gone to the city. A messenger was sent to
his son, Khojeh Meer, in Behmaru; who stated
that two respectable persons came to fetch the
moollah, reporting that they did so by order of
Mahomed Akbar Khan, who required his immediate
attendance, as Lawrence and Trevor were
both with him, and the Envoy coming. Whether
the father and son are in league or not, remains
to be proved; but this man's secession (who was
much in Sir William's confidence) has caused us
all to be on the alert, expecting an attack, or mischief
of some kind.</p>

<p>There was an absurd report to-day, that the
enemy had sent us back the gun they captured
on the 23d, with the horses; and the gullibility
of John Bull was proved by many persons leaving
an auction of some of the deceased officers' property,
to go to the Kohistan gate, and find it was
all nonsense.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Shelled the village of Behmaru, whence
the enemy annoyed us by firing on our yaboos
sent out to endeavour to procure grain.</p>

<p>This day we had both rain and snow. Mahommed
Shah Khan Ghilzye is come into Cabul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
and therefore we think there must have been a
fight below, in which he has had the worst.</p>

<p>A Hindu merchant has offered to bring grain,
and lay it at the gate of Mahommed Shureef's fort
in the night. We are not to speak to his people;
and are eventually to pay him at the rate of one
Cabul seer for the rupee, and we are bound to take
200 kurwars. Also on every hundred maunds
being delivered, we are to lay down a bag of 1500
rupees as a present. He says many would assist
us, but are afraid; that as he is the first in the
market, he expects to make his fortune.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;The enemy are not showing any cavalry
to-day; and there is a rumour that they
have gone to meet the corps coming in from
Ghuznee&mdash;there was only infantry on the hillside;
however, some alarmists fancied that they
were coming down, which they never do without
horsemen: the bugles sounded, there was a great
bustle, and all ended in nothing.</p>

<p>We shelled Behmaru and the hill above it; and
also the two shops close to the village, one on
either side of the road, where there is a little
bridge, and the trees form an archway.</p>

<p>Ammunition was sent to the Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>The horses are hard up for grain: those for the
artillery have not been much looked after since
Lieut. Waller was wounded; and one of them is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
averred to have eaten his comrade's tail! That he
bit it off there is no doubt.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Abdoolah Khan's death has, it is said,
created some confusion in the city. Whilst still
living a report was spread of his decease; and,
like Alexander, he mounted his horse, and showed
himself to his followers; but the exertion was too
great for him, and he shortly after expired.</p>

<p>Amongst other political barometers, the manner
in which persons are spoken of indicates whether
affairs are going on well or ill: just now, things
are looking up again. A few days ago people
spoke of "The Macnaghtens;" then they became
again "Sir William and my Lady;" and to-day
they have left their refuge in a tent in cantonments,
and are gone into the great house again,
which they think will have a good effect, and
tend to quiet people's minds.</p>

<p>The politicals are again very mysterious, and
deny that any negotiations are going on, &amp;c .; but
letters come in constantly; and we know they are
treating with the Ghilzyes.</p>

<p>A new arrangement is made with Khojeh
Meer regarding grain: formerly he received fifty
rupees daily as bukshees, whether grain was procured
or not; now he is to have 500 rupees given
him on delivery of every hundred khurwars.</p>

<p>Sturt proposes to hut the men on the ramparts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
and give them plenty of firewood. As yet they
are not allowed any fires, except for cooking their
food. He also wishes to have the city shelled,
both from the Bala Hissar and the cantonments,
particularly to annoy the quarter where the gunpowder-makers
reside.</p>

<p>Early this morning a party of horsemen left
the city in the direction of Bhoodkhak, and another
towards the Kohistan.</p>

<p>Treaty is certainly going on; and we think
that the confederacy may be breaking up. Humza
Khan of Tezeen is said to be sending his women
away from Cabul, and many have been seen
mounted on yaboos going away on the road leading
to Bhoodkhak.</p>

<p><i>1st December.</i>&mdash;Mohun Lull writes that the
enemy will show in force to-day, and attack us
to-morrow. The firing we heard in the night
was an attack on the patrol, who got in safe.</p>

<p>A cossid reported yesterday that he had been
with his letter to Kelat-i-Ghilzye, but he brought
no letter back. He said that the force had left
the place; and as he could not give any account
of, or letters from Ghuznee, we suspect that he
never went at all.</p>

<p>A report to-day that the Hindu merchant
had commenced his supplies of grain is contradicted:
but a small quantity was got in to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
We sent to get some barley for our horses; but
the enemy were hovering about the villages, and
prevented us.</p>

<p>It is reported that the garrison at Ghuznee
have blown up the bastions, and joined General
Nott's force.</p>

<p>More treaty going on. Firing at night, said to
be an attempt to blow up the Bala Hissar gate,
which was repulsed. A good deal of firing
during the night, and also shelling into the town.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;Last night's firing was an unsuccessful
attempt of the enemy on the Bourj above the Bala
Hissar.</p>

<p>I counted this morning 49 horsemen on the
Siah Sung Hill, who were reported to the
General at 300! We did not fire at them, as
they were seen to come from Mahmood Khan's
Fort, where the Ghilzyes reside who are now
treating with us.</p>

<p>Mohun Lull's information was incorrect; the
enemy did not show in force yesterday, neither
have they to-day made their intended attack on
the captured fort and that of the magazine. The
person who succeeds in taking the latter is promised
40,000 rupees, and the rents of the adjacent
lands.</p>

<p>The enemy's confederacy is said to be breaking
up: they are now quarrelling regarding the partition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
of power which as yet they have not. One
says he will be chief of Cabul, another of Jellalabad,
&amp;c . The plan proposed for the capture of
cantonments by the enemy is, to send 200 bildars
in front to cut down the ramparts; next come the
infantry, and then the horse. I suppose we are
to stand still and look on.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan is said to be very ill.</p>

<p>There is a report that a man has come in from
Gen. Nott's camp at Urghundee, eighteen miles
off; that the enemy had attacked him, placing
two guns in position, both of which we are said
to have captured. We fear this news is too good
to be true. These reports are disseminated by the
enemy; and the only motive to which I can
attribute them is a wish to lull us into security
by reports of aid coming to us, until starvation
prompts acquiescence in their demands, be they
what they may.</p>

<p>A man of the Ghoorka corps has come in. He
says the men are wandering up and down the
country, and that some have taken refuge in
forts; that poor Rose, in a fit of despair, put an
end to his existence by shooting himself; and
that Dr. Grant, when he last saw him, was
wounded in the leg.</p>

<p>Ishmatoolah is said to be imprisoned in the
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
The Parsee merchant is also in prison until he
pays a ransom of 10,000 rupees: his property has
all been taken away.</p>

<p>The people of the city are said to be discontented.
They have no firewood; the people who
used to bring it in are afraid to do so lest they
should be plundered.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;The attack intended for yesterday has
been postponed to to-day, we hear; but there
seems to be little likelihood of one.</p>

<p>Khojeh Meer says that he has no more grain:
we only got 50 maunds in to-day. He also says
that the moollahs have been to all the villages,
and laid the people under ban not to assist the
English, and that consequently the Mussulman
population are as one man against us. He says
he expects himself to have to run for his life to
Peshawer whenever we go away. Khojeh Meer
has a difficult part, to play: his pecuniary gain in
siding with us is great; but being the father-in-law
of Meer Musjudee, who married the Khojeh's
daughter, he of course lets the enemy occupy the
village whenever they please. As far as we are
individually concerned, Khojeh Meer has been
very civil to us: he sells us grain whenever we
can manage to send an Affghan servant on a
yaboo to purchase it. Sturt has been kind to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
man; and he evinces his gratitude by writing to
say that he will get us what supplies he can.
Much more grain might have been procured, had
we not foolishly tried to drive hard bargains with
Khojeh Meer. It has been intimated to the
Envoy that the enemy's troops, who lately got
one rupee daily for each horseman, and eight anas
for each foot soldier, have not had any pay for
four days, and that they are grumbling at it.</p>

<p>We saw a party leaving Cabul towards Bhoodkhak
with two women on one horse riding with
them.</p>

<p>A cossid came in from Jellalabad; no letter
for me. He had been detained five days in the
city, and his intelligence only reached to the 21st.
Khojeh Meer says that the villages to our rear
(from whence the grain was brought to Behmaru)
are occupied; and that the only place which
could have given us grain, and where we might
have obtained six months' supply, was Khojeh
Rewash, which is at present occupied by Sekundu
Khan with 500 men.</p>

<p>In the evening about seven o'clock there was
firing on the southern face, and towards the
Magazine fort, which continued until past ten
o'clock. The enemy appear to be trying to mine
that fort, and Sturt saw about ten men close up
under the walls of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
The enemy seem to be on the alert; however
there was no firing at night of any consequence:
we shelled the city from the Bala Hissar as usual.</p>

<p>Orders were this day issued, that the arms and
accoutrements, discipline, &amp;c . of the various corps,
should be attended to! Consequent on this order
the 5th have been very busy cleaning their musket
barrels,&mdash;a most unusual exertion. The arms
used to be placed against the rampart, and of
course the barrels were rusty and the powder
damp.</p>

<p>A committee is ordered to assemble to-morrow
to value all useless horses in the Bazaar, which
are to be destroyed; so there will be plenty of
cheap meat, as tattoos and camels have for some
time past been eaten: even some of the gentlemen
ate camel's flesh, particularly the heart, which was
esteemed equal to that of the bullock. I never
was tempted by these choice viands; so cannot
offer an opinion regarding them.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton sent to tell Sturt that one of the
bastions of the captured fort was on fire, and to
request he would send bildars to dig the place
and lay on fresh earth. He went accordingly to
see what was the matter, and came back very
angry, as the guard had been burning the defences
he had put up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
<i>4th.</i>&mdash;Two chiefs have been treating with the
King: they propose that he throws off the Feringhees,
on which they will render their allegiance
to him. His Majesty, however, thinks it unsafe to
break with us. Gen. Nott's brigade is now supposed
to be at Shekoabad, about six marches
from Cabul. The enemy assembled in numbers
on the heights, and planted two guns in the gorge;
from which they discharged 144 shot at us (said
to have been scored on the wall of the Mission
Compound). They had three other guns out,
which were placed on the road behind a trench
they had dug, and a kind of breastwork they
had thrown up across the road, near the Shah
Bagh.</p>

<p>In front of this they had another for their men
to fire from behind it. Another party took post
in the Nullah, near the bridge going to Siah Sung.
A man mounted on a grey horse came down apparently
to see if they were properly posted: he had
a <i>foot</i> man with him. A shot was taken at the
latter, who, being beyond its range, ran a few
yards backwards and forwards, dancing, jumping,
and cutting capers in derision.</p>

<p>Just as it was getting dark the fight commenced
in earnest: the enemy made a rush at the captured
fort. They had placed a bag of powder at the
wicket, and must have been greatly astonished at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
finding it produced no effect in consequence of
Sturt having filled the place up.</p>

<p>They were received with a sharp fire, which was
kept up for a long time, both of musketry and
guns. Lieut. Cumberland, of the 44th, was on
duty there with 100 men. He sent for a reinforcement,
and Sturt took fifty men to him under
a very heavy fire. (Observe the wisdom of unnecessarily
risking the life of our only engineer officer.)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the enemy opened five
guns on us, our loss was very trifling: as yet I
have heard only of one man, an artilleryman,
killed; and a sergeant of Sturt's (Williams) was
wounded whilst digging with the sappers. A few
horses and camels were killed, as also one or two
camp followers in the Mission Compound.</p>

<p>Some of the cannon shot went clean over the
cantonments (those fired from the gorge): one fell
between the legs of Mr. Mein's mule in Sturt's
compound, near the rear gate, without doing any
damage.</p>

<p>To-day Sturt came home with his clothes singed,
having been nearly blown up by an explosion of
powder in one of the batteries, when a man got his
pouch ignited by the port-fire; he was much hurt:
at 10 o'clock the shots were dropping quickly.</p>

<p>I can scarcely believe that this is the grand attempt
at capturing cantonments; and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
am expecting another, and wish it may occur by
daylight.</p>

<p>The enemy's idea of blowing open a gate is
excellent. They filled the bag with powder, applied
and lighted a slow match, and then threw it
at the gate! so that, when it exploded, of course
it did no harm.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;The enemy assembled in small parties on
the Siah Sung Hill; also, but not in great force, on
the other hills.</p>

<p>In the morning they attacked a foraging party
sent by the cavalry, and surrounded them in a
fort. At length they took an oath on the Koran
not to hurt them; and a trooper, notwithstanding
the remonstrances of the rest, came out: he talked
with them, shook hands with them, and they
seemed very friendly. They then desired the
camp followers to come out; but they distrusted
them, and called to the trooper to return to them:
as he was doing so they shot him. The grasscutters
had amongst them one old musket, with
which they shot two of the enemy: further operations
were suspended by the arrival of a reinforcement,
when the enemy disappeared <i>instanter</i>.</p>

<p>Some ottah has been said to have been dropped
at the Musjed; but this has been contradicted,
and I believe no grain has been brought in to-day.</p>

<p>The chief of Khojeh Rewash says that we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
send a force, to make it appear that we force it from
him; and then he will sell us grain.</p>

<p>The proprietor of Kella Bolund offers 1000
kurwars of grain if we will send for it, and has
given the Envoy an order for its delivery; but the
difficulty lies in getting at it.</p>

<p>Major Kershaw has sent to announce that the
enemy are coming out of the city gate with their
guns.</p>

<p>There has been firing all day, but I believe
only a bheestee of Mr. Eyre's killed, just behind
our compound.</p>

<p>In the evening, about five o'clock, there was
very quick firing about the Bazar village.</p>

<p>The enemy have burnt the bridge, and commenced
mining one of the bastions of the captured
fort.</p>

<p>A strong reinforcement has been sent there;
and Sturt is gone down again, at nine at night,
to look to its defences.</p>

<p>Sturt has again to-day narrowly escaped being
shot. The enemy seem to know and to lie in
wait for him, and he never shows his head
above the rampart without a ball whistling
close to it. The Affghans are good shots when
they fire from their rests; and as the ammunition
is the property of each individual, they do not throw
it away as we do ours. Their gunners appear to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
inferior, as they fired at the captured fort at a
distance of 300 yards, yet did not hit it.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Sturt was out till one o'clock this morning.
Between twelve and one he crept round the
fort and got into the enemy's mine: they had
worked in about eight feet. He blew up the mine,
which fell in and destroyed the covered way
they had made, and shook down part of the garden
wall.</p>

<p>News from the Bala Hissar that the enemy are
evidently thinning their numbers; and a Ghilzye
chief who has been wounded is gone home.</p>

<p>A cossid, who was sent by the King to Ghuznee,
has returned. He says he was stopped half way
and put in kyde; that during the time he was a
prisoner another cossid arrived, sent to Amenoollah
Khan from the Kelat-i-Ghilzye chiefs
with a letter. This man told him that he was
the bearer of a request for troops and guns,
without which they could not prevent the Feringhee
King reaching Cabul; and that four regiments
of infantry, 100 horse, and five guns were
already at Karabagh, two marches from Ghuznee:
that this occurred five days since (about the 1st).
The cossid took his oath on the Koran, before four
moollahs, to the truth of his statement; desired he
might be put in prison (in which he was accommodated);
and further begged if the force did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
not arrive they would put him to death! So
after all this asseveration he was, of course, implicitly
believed.</p>

<p>At daybreak not a vestige remained of the
bridge; which, however, the General is still very
anxious to rebuild, and has sent to inquire if
Sturt can do so. Without materials or workmen,
and the enemy on the spot, it is as impossible as
useless to attempt it.</p>

<p>The General refused to have a party stationed
in the small fort to defend this same bridge, and
now it is gone. He seems more bewildered than
ever, and says if the force arrives there will only
be more mouths to eat up our provisions; and we
have only eight days', this inclusive; but we have
not a man to send out to forage.</p>

<p>The enemy were out to-day, but not in great
force. They have got a Russian seventeen-pounder
of brass, which they have brought in
from the Kohistan, and have planted it in the
road, near and on this side of Mahmood Khan's
fort. From this they have been firing at us all
day, and the balls fall many of them in the
gardens of Messrs. Eyre and Sturt's house. We
have picked up three cannon balls close to the
door of the verandah.</p>

<div class="image-left">
  <img width="200" height="104" alt="" src="images/room.jpg" />
</div>

<p class="nodent">Lieut. Hawtrey of the 37th N. I. was on duty
at the captured fort to-day with 100 men&mdash;forty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
of these were of the 44th, the rest from the 37th.
Suppose this to be the fort: * no outlet, the window
being blocked up with mud. In this room were six of the 44th. The
Affghans planted their crooked sticks, which
served them for scaling ladders; got up one by
one; pulled out the mud, and got in. A child
with a stick might have repulsed them. The
Europeans had their belts and accoutrements off,
and the Sipahees the same. They all ran away
as fast as they could! The 44th say that the
37th ran first, and as they were too weak they went
too. Hawtrey says there was not a pin to choose,&mdash;all
cowards alike. After he was deserted by the
men, he himself threw six hand grenades before
he followed them. One man of the 44th was an
exception, and he was shot whilst assisting
Hawtrey in throwing these missiles.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gray, 44th, was wounded in the arm
earlier in the day, by a man who climbed up and
fired through a loophole at him: he thoughtlessly
left his post to return to cantonments and get
his wound dressed; and the men endeavoured to
excuse themselves by saying their own officer was
not there to direct them. It was the most shameful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
of all the runaways that has occurred. The
men (all agree) were not dressed when the enemy
entered. The 37th had three men left dead in the
breach, and two were wounded, which certainly
looks as if they had defended themselves. We
lost 6000 rounds of ammunition in this fort.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton wished that the garrison who had
evacuated the fort should retake it. For this
purpose he got the men under arms as soon as
they could be collected together, and kept them,
regardless of the inclemency of the weather, with
snow lying on the ground, until three or four
o'clock in the morning; when they were eventually
dismissed, nothing being attempted.</p>

<p>The least thing seems to-day to create alarm.
The following note, accompanied by a six-pound
shot, was sent by order of Brig. Shelton to Sturt:</p>

 <p>"Dear Hogg&mdash;The enemy have planted a gun
 in a bastion of one of their forts, near the road
 leading to the Kohistan gate of the city, and
 have been firing it at the Magazine fort since
 one o'clock. Two or three shots struck the rear
 face. I send you one that fell in the room above
 the gateway, after passing through the wall.</p>

 <p class="yours">"Yours, <span class="smcap">W. Grant</span>."</p>

<p class="gap-above">Gen. Elphinstone wrote again to the Envoy to-day,
urging him to treat for terms with the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
At near 9 <small>A.M.</small> Sturt left us with an intention
of blowing up the captured fort, which the men
seem to have taken a dislike to, and to be determined
not to defend it. He had not been gone
more than a few minutes when quick firing commenced:
the enemy had come down evidently in
force along the south-eastern face of cantonments.
There was a blaze of light from Mahmood Khan's
fort to our rear gate: it did not last long, but it
was a very anxious time; for our north-eastern
portion of rampart is occupied by the 5th, and I
distinctly heard Bygrave using no gentle language
whilst he kicked the men up and out of their tents.
Lieut. Mein (13th) was also active in assisting to
do the same, but with very little success; though
the drums beating to arms, and the hallooing
and shouting for the General and the Brigadier,
were noise enough to have aroused the dead.
Lieut. Deas was on the rear gate guard; and had
a rush been made at it by the enemy, there did
not seem to be any one to oppose them.</p>

<p>Yesterday when Sturt was talking to the
General and the Brigadier about the captured
fort, he mentioned that Capt. Layton commanded
there that day, and that he wished he should
remain and retain it as a permanent command, it
being a place for which an officer should be selected,
and he considered him as well fitted for the command.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
Shelton, with a sneer, asked if Layton
would like to stay there? To which Sturt replied,
"I do not know what he would like, but I know
that I should wish him to do so." Capt. Layton's
courage and steadiness were too unimpeachable
for the sneer to affect his character as a soldier.
The Brigadier's dislike to him arose from his not
being a man of polished manners, and rather ungrammatical
in his language.</p>

<p>After all had gone wrong, the Brigadier told
Sturt that he had told him to order Capt. Layton
to remain, and appealed to the General whether
he did not; to which Elphinstone hesitatingly
replied, yes. On Sturt saying that he never
understood such an order, and that their recollections
of the conversation were different from his;
that he would not give up his own reminiscence
of the business; that he (Sturt) was wide awake at
the time; the Brigadier lying on the floor rolled
up in his bedding, and either really or affectedly
half asleep. On this the General hedged off
evasively by saying, he did not think what was
said amounted to an order!</p>

<p>Now when Sturt mentioned the circumstance
to me yesterday, I asked him whether he thought
they would select an officer as a permanent
commandant, and his reply was, "God knows."
Besides if it was to be, it would have been notified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
in Orders, being a decided innovation on the
daily relief of the fort.</p>

<p>"One example is as good as a million:" these
circumstances show how affairs are carried on.
The General, unsettled in his purposes, delegates
his power to the Brigadier, and the Brigadier tries
to throw off all responsibility on the General's or
any body's shoulders except his own: and the
General is, as in the present instance, too gentlemanlike
to tell him that he deviates a little from
the exact line, and thus takes on himself the
evasion.</p>

<p>Sturt came home quite disgusted; vowing that
if those dear to him were not in cantonments,
they might blow them up for what he cared.</p>

<p>I heard a piece of private intelligence to-day,&mdash;that
three of the Envoy's Chuprassies and a
Duffodar of the 4th Ressallah, with two other
persons whose names have not transpired, are in
connection with the enemy; and this treasonable
correspondence has been discovered by some intercepted
letters. The men had been disposing of
their property two days previous to the discovery.
The three Chuprassies are in confinement, and the
Envoy talks of asking the General for a court-martial
on them. The chances are they will
escape punishment: whereas were they hanged as
traitors at once, it might be an useful lesson to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
others. We have a Fakir and some Affghans
in confinement also, who are suspected of being
spies.</p>

<p>The General peremptorily forbade the camp
followers trying to take away the piles of the
bridge that remained; so the enemy, who are hard
up for wood, came down in great numbers, and
did it for us. To-day we have seven days' provisions
left.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Sturt was anxious to take the <i>re</i>captured
fort; and as it appears that the men are determined
not to keep it, he proposed to blow it up,
and to call for volunteers for that purpose.</p>

<p>The 44th say they wish to wipe out the stain
on their name, as do the 37th. Hawtrey's company
volunteer to go with him, and take it without
the assistance of any other troops.</p>

<p>In sending the Sipahees to that fort, the sixty
men were taken six from each company, so that
very few could have had their own officer, European
or native, havildars, jemadars, or even
their own comrades. It was certainly a particularly
bad arrangement.</p>

<p>The General wished to know from Sturt
whether the fort was practicable and tenable; at
least this was the message brought by Capt.
Bellew: to which Sturt said but one reply could be
made&mdash;"Practicable if the men will fight: tenable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
if they do not run away!"&mdash;but that he considered
that the great object was to destroy it; as he more
than doubted the willingness of the troops to garrison
it, although daily relieved.</p>

<p>Objections were raised as to any other measures
being taken than firing at it to batter it down,
which was accordingly done all day. The
enemy showed again; but their numbers are
thinning: they fired at us all day; and the balls
from the brass seventeen-pounder just opposite
came whizzing over and about Sturt's house and
garden.</p>

<p>Our chiefs are very anxious regarding three
galleries that the enemy are said to be running
from various points to the Bazar bastion. They
are said to have mined 100 yards towards it from
the captured fort. Hadjee Mahommed, the
famous miner from the Kohistan, has twenty
men with him; and the enemy have great confidence
in his skill, and have given him 12,000
rupees.</p>

<p>I wonder if they paid the conquering hero of
the captured fort their promised reward of 4000
rupees?</p>

<p>The report is, that the Affghans have sworn on
the Koran to take the Bazar fort and the Magazine
fort: for the latter they are to receive
10,000 rupees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
The Envoy is in hopes to get in five days' provisions
from the Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan sent in, offering us
terms to go out, bag and baggage: but this was
before the fort was taken, and he will now probably
rise in his demands, which have not transpired.
No reply has yet been given, as hopes are
entertained of the arrival of Gen. Nott's force
before we are quite starved: besides, as Zeman
Shah Khan has not given up the power to Mahommed
Akbar Khan, he may not be able to
guarantee our safety.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;The first news of the day was, that the
ammunition destined for the Bala Hissar during
last night set out, eighty yaboos, escorted by some
of Skinner's horse, under Capt. Hay: when they
got to the camel sheds they found themselves
between two fires, of which, however, but one
shot hit a trooper. On the first shot being fired,
many of the saces threw off their loads, and
galloped as hard as they could. Only forty-four
laden yaboos arrived: five were lost altogether,
with many yaboos and loads of private baggage;
for there was (now, when the enemy's suspicions
were raised) an idea of trying to throw ammunition
into the Bala Hissar, and of eventually endeavouring
to force our way there: and a good deal of private
property was attempted to be sent in with it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
We did not send any thing, expecting that our
goods would never reach their destination.</p>

<p>Had Sturt's wish been complied with, long ago
we should have been safe in the Bala Hissar, with
plenty of provisions, and might have set all
Affghanistan at defiance until an army could
arrive from the provinces.</p>

<p>The orders given to the reserve last night
were, to go to the rescue if the convoy was
attacked on its return; but as there was no order
to defend the animals laden with ammunition when
going, they waited until Brig. Shelton should
arrive, and when of course it was too late, and
all was over.</p>

<p>Conolly and Jan Fishan Khan have come in,
I believe to press the subject of our all going to
the Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>The General now says that it was Sturt who
objected to the attempt on the Captured fort:&mdash;rather
an odd assertion, as he was not likely to
object to his own proposition!</p>

<p>There is a report that the Wallee of Khoolloom
is coming to our assistance. To-day there has
been much firing in the city; and Dr. Duff says
he saw with a glass the people in the Kuzzilbash
quarter fighting from the tops of the houses.</p>

<p>Yesterday the servants of Mr. Steer and of some
other officers asserted that they heard distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
firing of artillery across the gorge behind Cabul,
but no one gave much credit to it. This morning
both Sturt and Warburton heard the booming of
very distant artillery, and several other persons
did the same. Ghuznee is only about eighty miles
from us: so that the firing might be from thence:
but it is confidently asserted that the Kandahar
force must be near; and three days are given as
the period for their arrival.</p>

<p>Great anxiety, occasioned by a new mine
reported to be commenced at the mill, which
Kershaw has examined, as also Sturt and his
sergeants, and there does not happen to be any
such thing!</p>

<p>Two days since we saw a funeral procession,
with about fifty followers, going away by the road
leading towards the ground lately occupied by the
Shah's camp.</p>

<p>To-day we saw a number of laden camels and
yaboos, and sheep, and people, all going away:
they were escorted off in safety by horsemen, who
returned as soon as they were out of sight of cantonments.
A number also went off towards the
Kohistan; and we think the confederacy must be
breaking up, as we see very few of the enemy now,
either horse or foot; and the information from the
Bala Hissar now rates their numbers at 2500
fighting men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
A letter was sent by the General to the Envoy,
finding fault with the site of cantonments, adverting
to our want of provisions, &amp;c .; and also urgently
pointing out the necessity of the Envoy's negotiating
with the enemy for the best terms he could
get from them. This letter was signed by the
four members of the council of war,&mdash;Major-Gen.
Elphinstone, Brig. Shelton, Brig. Anquetil, and
Col. Chambers. Anquetil appended to his signature,
"I concur in this opinion in a military
point of view."</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Another letter, much of the same tenor,
from the General to the Envoy.</p>

<p>Letters received from Jellalabad, but not by me.
I wrote to Sale by the return cossid, from the 18th
inclusive. Mackeson had thrown provisions into
Alimusjid; and 400 Usutzyes were raising for its
defence. The Afreedees' allegiance was doubtful,
and they were likely on any reverse to become our
open enemies.</p>

<p>Sale had written to the Commander-in-chief to
say that reinforcements for this country must be
much greater than those now on their way; that
there must be a strong siege train, engineer officers,
with all <i>materiel</i>&mdash;light infantry, British infantry,
and dragoons; and had stated that the whole
country was in insurrection, and up against us.
In a postscript he mentions that on the day he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
wrote the first, they had sallied and entirely defeated
the enemy.</p>

<p>Treating is still going on. We have only three
days' provisions! The Ben-i-shehr is rich in grain.
Conolly at the Bala Hissar offers to take it with
the escort, but is not permitted; and to send
a force from cantonments it would require a
much larger one than we can afford; the same
misfortune attaches to Killa Bolund and Khojeh
Rewash.</p>

<p>The King wrote to say that John Conolly and
Jan Fishan Khan, who came into cantonments,
must not return to the Bala Hissar last night, as
there were Juzailchees out for the purpose of
cutting them off. They therefore went in at five
this morning. They got in safe, though their
escort was fired upon.</p>

<p>We had Sturt's yaboo paraded this morning,
who did not seem to feel the smallest inconvenience,
notwithstanding that he had been knocked down
by a nine-pounder shot yesterday. The ball struck
the rampart and rebounded on to his neck, which
was protected by such a mane as would not be
believed on description, being of the very shaggiest
of those in this country.</p>

<p>At one this morning Sturt was roused up
to examine a wall that Brig. Shelton wished to
have pulled down, and was kept out, with Capt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
Hawtrey and fifty men, for an hour. It proved to
be a mare's nest, and the party were sent on a
harassing duty for no purpose!</p>

<p>The 44th have asked for a court of inquiry,
and it is to sit to-morrow: but there is but too
much evidence to prove that the Europeans were
the first to run away from the Captured fort. The
artillerymen in the bastions all assert that they
were so, and also the first into cantonments; and
the rest of the regiment have <i>cut</i> that company;
and men are generally good judges of their comrades'
conduct.</p>

<p>Capt. Trevor was sent by Sir William to
meet several Ghilzye chiefs who had volunteered
to enter into terms with him, on payment of
two lakhs of rupees, which sum was taken by
Trevor that night, but only one person met
him, who said that the others had seceded from
the engagement, and they would not receive the
money. They had declared that, although connected
by marriage with Mahommed Akbar Khan,
they had no regard for him, and would, if Sir
William wished it, bring his head; but he replied,
assassination was not our custom.</p>

<p>The alarm was sounded, and at the same time
there was a signal flying from the Bala Hissar, of
the enemy being in force in the Shah's garden.
They were making a place to fire behind; from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
which we drove them. We had the usual firing
all day, and dismounted one of their guns.</p>

<p>Early this morning I was awakened by firing,
proceeding from a party under a Duffodar, in
charge of twenty yaboos, with 100 sacks to be
filled with grain at the Bala Hissar. They
were fired on by the enemy; and came scampering
back without their bags, and having lost six
ponies.</p>

<p>Capt. Hay was this day sent with a message
of consequence to the King, attended by an escort
of fifty horse. He went out of cantonments at a
brisk trot, and forded the river. The enemy kept
an excellent look-out; they were immediately in
pursuit, but our party got safe into the Bala
Hissar. It was a beautiful sight to see Hay with
his cap pulled down on his brows, his teeth set,
neither looking right nor left, but leading his men
with the air of a man ready and expecting to
encounter the worst, and fully determined to do his
<i>devoir</i>. We were all very anxious about him, and
were delighted to hear that he had got back safe, for
they were fired on in returning, and ten horses
without riders were the heralds of their return.
One man only is missing, and we hope he may
yet find his way in, as it is very dark, and the
enemy may miss him.</p>

<p>To avoid the enemy, they had to make a <i>détour</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
out of the road some miles, and the men got dismounted
by their horses stumbling and falling
into ditches, &amp;c . There was much anxiety relative
to the purport of the message. It was supposed
to be an urgent entreaty from the Envoy
to the King, that the latter would come into cantonments
for the purpose of retreating with the
army to India: whatever it was, it produced an
order for the immediate evacuation of the Bala
Hissar by our troops.</p>

<p>The enemy have been busy to-day making a
platform (said to be 12 feet by 4) behind the commissariat
fort.</p>

<p>It is surmised that this is a contrivance to cross
the ditch with; but, as that is 20 feet wide, it is
not likely to succeed. They are said to have
appeared to be trying its strength by walking
over it.</p>

<p>This day orders have been issued to deprive
all camp followers that are not mustered of their
grain rations; but those who will take meat are
permitted to have it in lieu. We have commenced
giving our servants two sheep a day. Between
Sturt's servants, mine, and Mr. Mein's (who is
staying with us), we muster forty.</p>

<p>Sturt was told yesterday that two of his sappers
were going to desert, and he had the circumstance
reported; but the General and Capt. Bellew would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
not put them into confinement, because their plan
being overheard was not considered as a sufficient
proof of their intentions: so they ordered them to
be watched; and the end of the story is, that to-day
they are not to be found. A second case of most
excellent surveillance.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Early this morning, a convoy went to
and returned from the Bala Hissar, having conveyed
bags there to be filled with grain.</p>

<p>An armistice; and chiefs came to treat with the
Envoy: they met on the plain; and whilst the
negotiations (which were lengthy) were carrying
on, the enemy were busy throwing up works and
placing guns in position.</p>

<p>A letter was received last night from Ghuznee:
that place was invested; and Col. MacLaren was
marching up with troops, who were somewhere
between Candahar and that place.</p>

<p>As we have only two days' provisions, terms
have been accepted. As far as I can learn, four
political hostages are to be given&mdash;Pottinger,
Trevor, MacGregor, and Conolly&mdash;to insure the
return of the Dost.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan is to go down with us.
They say they will give us carriage, and we are to
be off on Tuesday. The 54th from the Bala Hissar
are to come in to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;The troops from the Bala Hissar have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
not come in, at the desire of the chiefs; who have
now decided that they wish the Shah to remain,
and only require us to go. They wish the King
to strengthen their allegiance by giving his
daughters in marriage to the chiefs, and receiving
theirs in return.</p>

<p>They were anxious to have our ladies as
hostages, but it was refused.</p>

<p>The Kuzzilbashes have every thing to lose,
should the Dost return, and the Barukzye power
come in.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Another letter from Gen. Elphinstone,
urging the Envoy to treat with the chiefs.</p>

<p>A report prevalent that it is wished the force
should remain; which is, however, discredited.</p>

<p>The Kohistanees are in great numbers in
Behmaru, the Shahbagh, &amp;c .; and unless the
chiefs take possession of the forts <i>near</i>, and probably
have a party <i>in</i> cantonments, they will
certainly get in, and loot immediately on our going
out.</p>

<p>A curious scene occurred to-day. The men are
to leave their old muskets, and take fresh ones out
of the magazine. Without any order or arrangement
the Europeans, Sipahees, and camp followers
all got into the midst of the stores, and helped
themselves to whatever came in their way; it was
a regular scene of plunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
<i>14th.</i>&mdash;The troops left the Bala Hissar last
night, but it was considered unsafe for them to
come on here on account of the lateness of the
hour. Immediately on their getting outside the
gate, a rush was made by Mahommed Akbar
Khan's men, that chief wishing to seize on the
Bala Hissar, and the person of the King. His
majesty had the gates shut, and in so doing shut
in the quarter guard, with some prisoners of the
54th. Finding that the force could not come
on, Conolly returned to the gate to ask to be
re-admitted, at which time he was saluted with
a discharge of grape, had one horse shot under
him, and another wounded. This was afterwards
explained away as having been intended for
the King's and our mutual foes: if so, they were
not very particular as to which party they fired
at. Our troops remained out all night; and
this morning had to fight their way in, against
a mixed rabble of Ghilzyes, Logurees, and
Cabulees.</p>

<p>The bullock drivers ran away from the nine-pounder
gun; of which the enemy took possession.
They carried off the bullocks; but being near cantonments,
fresh animals were sent out (it was on
this side of the Siah Sung Hill), the gun was
soon recaptured; but not till an unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
artilleryman, who being sick rode on it, had been
cut to pieces.</p>

<p>Osman Khan sent to say that if one of the
three lakhs promised to him was sent this evening,
he would send in provisions, of which we are
in great need, having only sufficient for to-day and
to-morrow's consumption. In the evening three
and a half lakhs were sent.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;There is a very evident change in politics.
"The good King," as Sir William used to call him,
is now thrown over by us, as he refused to
deviate from his accustomed hauteur towards his
nobles, or to admit of his daughters marrying the
chiefs as they proposed.</p>

<p>Shah Shoojah has also set his seal to a proclamation
calling on all true Mussalmans to fight
against the Feringhees.</p>

<p>A small quantity of ottah was brought in to-day.</p>

<p>Negotiations are still going on.</p>

<p>The chiefs are very anxious to have all the
married men and their families as hostages for the
Dost's safe return.</p>

<p>Two days since the King was to have come into
cantonments, in rather light marching order, to
accompany us to the provinces. At that time it
was decided that Osman Khan (head of the Barukzyes
now in the country, and at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
Vizier) should remain at Cabul: and it being
expected that the expulsion of our force would be
a scene of bloodshed and disaster, a running fight
all the way down, Sturt said, that if he could
see Osman Khan himself, and make his own terms
with him for our safety and protection in his own
house, he would not object to being one of the
hostages, and keeping his wife and mother with
him: he authorized Capt. Lawrence to say as
much to the Envoy. To his great astonishment
he heard that his name had been proposed to the
chiefs without any further communication with
him, and with a state of politics wholly different
from those under which he would have acquiesced
in the proposition. In the first place, Shah
Shoojah is not going with our army; but is doing
all he can to raise a party against us, and sits
at a window of his palace in the Bala Hissar,
whence he distributes shawls, khelluts, and bhoodkhees
to the Ghazeeas. In the second place,
Osman Khan is one of the chiefs who it is now
decided are to go down with the Envoy.</p>

<p>Sturt's having talked imprudently to a friend,
and its being taken advantage of, prevents his
interfering in the affair; but <i>I</i> am not so tied, and
have represented (through friends) to the General
in a military point of view that he ought to object
to Sturt's being taken as a hostage, on the plea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
that should there be any thing to do on the way
down, through the Khyber or in the Punjab, he is
the only engineer officer we have;&mdash;a circumstance
which the General acknowledges escaped his recollection,
but he quickly remedied the ill by writing
to the Envoy on the subject; and time must show
the result.</p>

<p>Determined not to put his wife and myself in
the enemy's power, he wrote to the Envoy as follows:&mdash;</p>

 <p>"My dear Sir William,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within the last hour a report has reached
 me, that myself, Lady Sale, and Mrs. Sturt, had
 been proposed to the Cabul chiefs as hostages, in
 exchange for Capt. Trevor.</p>

 <p>"I have a very distinct recollection of having
 told Lawrence to mention to you, that I had no
 objection to such an arrangement <i>under certain
 terms</i>; but not having been made acquainted with
 the fact of such a proposition having been made,
 or further consulted on the subject, I write in
 much anxiety to inquire if there is any foundation
 for the report, and if there is, to be made acquainted
 with the arrangements proposed, under
 which I can be expected to acquiesce in them as
 far as regards Lady Sale and Mrs. Sturt; for
 myself I am ready for any circumstances likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
 benefit or aid in bringing negotiations to a satisfactory
 conclusion. I trust you will ease my
 mind upon this point, for reports have reached
 me from several quarters, all of which are more
 vague than satisfactory.</p>

 <p class="yours">"Very truly yours,<br />
 "<span class="smcap">J. L. D. Sturt</span>.</p>

 <p>"15th December, 1841."</p>

<p class="gap-above">This elicited a reply from Sir William stating
that he was much hurried by business, and did not
recollect whether Sturt's name had been mentioned
to the chiefs or not; but it was of no consequence,
as no ladies were to be sent as hostages,
&amp;c . The letter was evasive and diplomatic; and
did not inform us whether Sturt was to be sent
from us or not. It was, I believe, unfortunately
thrown amongst a heap of papers which Sturt was
destroying, for I could not find it afterwards.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;The impudence of these Affghans is very
great! Yesterday some men who were looting
our people close to the gates were warned off, and
they replied, that we might keep within our walls;
all <i>without</i> belonged to them.</p>

<p>To-day a well-dressed man, one of Mahommed
Akbar Khan's personal attendants, was attacked
by them close to the walls, and stripped of his
garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
Mr. Baness, the merchant, was standing talking
to some of the Affghans by the gate; a man
snatched his watch from him, ran up to a suwar,
knocked him off his horse, mounted it, and galloped
off.</p>

<p>This day Sturt was fortunate in purchasing a
bag of otta sent in to him by Taj Mahommed;
whose man brought another which our servants
were purchasing.</p>

<p>In a moment there was a cry of otta! and the
garden was filled with camp followers and Sipahees.
I never saw such a scene: the joy of
those who got a handful for a rupee, the sorrow
evinced by those who were unsuccessful, and the
struggles of all to get close to the man! The
gentlemen had to stand with thick sticks to keep
the people off. There was no weighing; at first
the man gave two handsful for a rupee, but the
quantity soon diminished in consequence of the
great demand for it.</p>

<p>To prove our good faith and belief in that of the
chiefs, we are to-day placed entirely in their
power.</p>

<p>They know that we are starving; that our horses
and cattle have neither grain, bhoosa, nor grass.
They have pretty well eaten up the bark of the
trees and the tender branches; the horses gnaw
the tent pegs. I was gravely told that the artillery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
horses had eaten the trunnion of a gun!
This is difficult of belief; but I have seen my own
riding-horse gnaw voraciously at a cart-wheel.
Nothing is <i>satisfied</i> with food except the Pariah
dogs, who are gorged with eating dead camels and
horses.</p>

<p>This evening the Rikabashees fort, Zulfa Khan's
fort, and the Magazine fort, were given up to the
chiefs.</p>

<p>Misseer Aollah Khan, brother of Nawaub
Zeman Shah Khan, came in as a hostage.</p>

<p>In the Magazine fort our allies are said to have
placed 4,000 men. The chiefs promised, as soon as
they were in possession of our forts, to give us
grain; and about half an hour after our garrisons
were withdrawn 155 maunds of otta and a small
quantity of bhoosa was brought in.</p>

<p>They have also promised to procure us 2,000
camels and 400 yaboos.</p>

<p>To show how strangely military matters are
conducted at present; we were taking our evening
walk on the ramparts, when a Sipahee quite out
of breath came up, and asked for the Brigade
Major, saying that he was sent from the Rikabashees
fort to ask for the order to give it up, as
the men were waiting outside the gate ready to
march off, and the Affghans were also waiting to
march in; as we plainly saw, when we stood near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
Bygrave's bastion. I do not attach any blame to
the General in this; but to those whose duty it
was to issue the orders and see them executed.</p>

<p>At eleven <small>P.M.</small> heard some firing, and began to
think there was going to be some treachery.</p>

<p>Our allies, as they are now called, will be very
magnanimous if they let us escape, now that they
have fairly got us in their net. It is said the
Bala Hissar will be attacked to-morrow by those
who are neither the King's nor our friends; though
they are now termed allies instead of enemies.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;There has been news from Jellalabad to-day
up to the 7th. I hear that Sale and all are
well there; but it came out by accident. The
Sikhs have refused to assist us, which is breaking
their treaty, and portends military movements in
the Punjab;&mdash;an additional reason why our only
engineer should not remain in Cabul.</p>

<p>Accounts from Candahar and Khelat-i-Gilzie.
All is right again, they say, at the former place;
that prompt measures were taken; a chief seized
and blown from a gun, which terrified the rest
into subjection. No further news from Ghuznee;
which, by the last accounts, was invested.</p>

<p>Both otta and bhoosa brought in to-day; but
not more than for the day's consumption, and
only for the commissariat. Camels were brought
in, and some sold to the commissariat for 140 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
150 rupees each. We offered 1000 rupees for
eight camels; but for so few they insisted on
receiving 200 for each. The plunderers were, as
usual, outside attacking all who passed, friend or
foe, and were fired on from the magazine fort:
the garrison there were also firing.</p>

<p>Sturt was standing at the rear gate, when a
man inquired if he was an officer; and, on his
asking why he wished to know, and what he
wanted with him, said, half drawing his sword,
"to fight."</p>

<p>It is said that our departure depends on the
King's reply, which was expected to be given
to-day. He is either to go with us to Loodianah,
to remain here, or to go on a pilgrimage to
Mecca.</p>

<p>In the city Zeman Shah Khan now reigns.</p>

<p>The people say that, as soon as we go, there
will be dreadful fighting; not such as they have
had with us, but chupaos on each other's houses,
sword in hand, and cutting each other's throats:
that we shall be attacked all the way to
Khoord Cabul, but not after that, as that part of
the country belongs to Ameenoollah Khan, whose
son goes with us.</p>

<p>Nothing decided regarding Sturt, but it is said
he will have to remain.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;When we rose this morning the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
was covered with snow; which continued falling
all day.</p>

<p>A very strange circumstance occurred last
night. Some persons were endeavouring to remove
the barricade at the gate of the mission
compound: on being discovered, two Europeans
galloped away, who were not recognised. The
third, &mdash;&mdash;, a writer in Capt. Johnson's office, was
taken prisoner: he refuses to name his companions,
and says they were going to Mahommed
Akbar Khan to obtain provisions for the army.
&mdash;&mdash; is a man of bad character; he has lately
got himself into bad repute by writing letters in
the newspapers under the signature of "Sharp."
He was also connected with a man of the name of
O'Grady Gorman in a correspondence with the
Russians; which was proved by letters found
amongst the papers of the latter after he was
murdered at Candahar.</p>

<p>Two men of the 54th have made their escape
out of the Bala Hissar; they passed a rope
through one of the loopholes and let themselves
down. They say the King has been tampering
with them, offering to give them 15 rupees a
month, and to promote all the non-commissioned
officers; but that not one has accepted his offers.</p>

<p>This day we bought camels at 150 rupees each.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;More strange things have occurred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Brig. Shelton wrote privately to Mahommed
Akbar Khan for forage for his own use, and
obtained ten loads of bhoosa. He made the man
who brought it a present (writing to Sir William
that he wished to have a pair of pistols or a
chogah of small value from the Tosha Khana to
present to a respectable native), and the present
was sent with a bill attached to it for 30 rupees.
On its arrival, Shelton left the room to receive it,
and during his absence the Affghan appropriated
to himself a sword which had been a gift to the
Brigadier from Shah Shoojah. On this he applied
to the Envoy for its restoration, which brought
the whole story to light; and occasioned the
Brigadier to receive an admonition for having,
unknown to the Envoy, entered into correspondence
with one of the chiefs. The General, having
heard the former part of the above story, wrote to
the Envoy to ascertain if he also could not obtain
forage from Akbar direct; but Sir William was
extremely indignant at any attempt at correspondence
being entered into with any of the
chiefs by individuals, and peremptorily forbade
it; having the courtesy to add, that he was in
expectation of obtaining some for himself, of
which he would permit Gen. Elphinstone to have
a part.</p>

<p>The chiefs are evidently fearful that we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
getting in supplies to a greater extent than they
wish.</p>

<p>We had been fortunate enough to purchase
some otta and barley for our servants and cattle.
A servant of Mahommed Akbar Khan's came
into our verandah and wanted to take it away by
force; but I saw what was going on, and called
Sturt, who took him by the collar, and expedited
his departure by a kick; to the great astonishment
of sundry Affghans at such indignity being offered
to the servant of a sirdar.</p>

<p>Snow again fell to-day.</p>

<p>In a letter from Gen. Elphinstone to the Envoy
to-day, he observes, "that the force is not in
a state to act in any way necessity might require;
but he hoped that it would be better disposed to-morrow!"</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Taj Mahommed Khan came again to see
Sturt; and through his servants we got some
new cheese. He told us that Shamsuddeen's
brother died last night.</p>

<p>Taj Mahommed assures us of the intended
treachery of Akbar; and says the force will be
annihilated, and is most anxious that we should
accept such protection as he is willing to afford
us somewhere in the hills until the return of the
English;&mdash;for that a strong force will be sent to
retake Cabul, and avenge the meditated destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
of our army, is a general opinion amongst the
thinking Affghans, several of whom, as well as
Taj Mahommed Khan, obtained written testimonials
of their friendship towards the English,
that they may hereafter produce them for their
advantage. We can only thank him for his good
intentions. It is difficult to make these people
understand our ideas on military subjects; and
how a proceeding, which was only intended to
save a man's life, conjointly with that of his wife
and mother, can in any way affect his honour.
Certain it is that we have very little hope of
saving our lives.</p>

<p>The Envoy seems to fear treachery on the part
of the chiefs; and evidently wishes to break the
treaty. If he does so, it must be by a simultaneous
attack on the three forts we have given up
to our "allies," and also on Mahommed Khan's fort.
It would, if successful, give us a decided advantage,
and perhaps alarm many into siding with us; but
the plan is too late a one. Sturt was applied to
for a sketch of operations, which he gave, for the
attack on Mahommed Khan's fort, but was of
opinion we were too weak, and our men too dispirited,
to attempt it. On this subject he received
a letter from the General, of which the following
is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span></div>

 <p>"My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not know whether Thain has written
 to you the substance of a conversation I had
 this day with the Envoy. He thinks it possible
 we may be driven to hostilities, and asked, with
 the view to the recapture of the magazine (fort
 omitted), whether we had ladders, or the means of
 making them. I hope they will not drive us to
 this, although things look very ill and very like
 treachery.</p>

 <p class="yours">"Yours,<br />"W. K. E."</p>

 <p>"20th Dec."</p>

<p class="gap-above">The Envoy had a meeting with the allies this
evening: he says they have not broken their
treaty, but are fearful we shall break ours. The
chiefs rise daily in their demands; and to-day required
that we should send the guns and ammunition
that were to be left at once into Mahmood
Khan's fort.</p>

<p>They now will not give up Trevor; because, as
the Envoy wishes to get him back, they take it
for granted he is a person of consequence. The
affair of the sword has made the same impression
regarding Brig. Shelton, whom the chiefs have demanded,
with Captains Grant and Conolly. Trevor
is with them, and Drummond and Skinner are
still detained in the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
Chiefs, or their deputies, daily come in to negotiate;
but we have only Moussa Khan with us as
an "honoured guest."</p>

<p>Sturt has proposed to the General that we
break off all treaty, and openly retreat to Jellalabad;
directing Sale to remain there, and the
whole force to await the arrival of troops either at
Jellalabad or Peshawer; not to leave our sick, as
was intended, with Zeman Shah Khan, but to take
all officers' and other private baggage for them,
and the ammunition, allowing a small portion for
women and children. The staff and sick officers
to be allowed a riding horse, the others to
march with their men. This is a public-spirited
proposition of his; for we had succeeded, at great
expense, in obtaining carriage for his most valuable
property, which, by this arrangement, must be
abandoned, and for which it was possible he would
not receive any recompence.</p>

<p>We hear that the inhabitants of the fortress of
Ghuznee communicated with the enemy without;
and by a coalition have driven our troops from all
other parts than the citadel and the Cabul gateway.
Now, had we retreated to the citadel in the
Bala Hissar, as Sturt recommended before the
Rikabashees' fort was taken, and often afterwards,
we should not now be in the humiliating situation
that we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
The troops sent to the relief of Ghuznee only
got two marches beyond Khelat-i-Ghilzie: their
further progress is said to have been prevented,
not only by the overpowering numbers of the
enemy, but also by the snow, which rendered the
passes impracticable; they fell back upon Candahar,
leaving reinforcements in Khelat-i-Ghilzie.</p>

<p>Orders were despatched yesterday to Ghuznee,
for the surrender of that place. The troops will
have to march through the Zoormut country, and
go down by Dera Ismael Khan.</p>

<p>Thursday is at present said to be the day for
our departure.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The hostages are decided on,&mdash;Airey,
Pottinger, Warburton, and Conolly, who are to
start immediately for the city.</p>

<p>The Envoy met Osman Khan and Mahommed
Akbar Khan in conference.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;The waggons, ammunition, &amp;c ., given
up to our "allies."</p>

<p>Lady Macnaghten's carriage and horses given
to Mahommed Akbar Khan.</p>

<p>The troops were kept under arms for two hours
about nothing. Some cavalry horses were sent
out to be shot: the Affghans wished to take them
away, but the guard (37th) bayoneted one man,
and shot another; on which they dispersed.</p>

<p>The Affghans say, that if, when we retook the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
gun on the hill, on the 23d of last month, we had
pursued to the gates of Cabul, they would never
have made head against us again. They say they
cannot understand Shelton's conduct on the hill
on that day; and that, if our generals can do no
more, the Affghans have nothing to fear from them.
This is nearly verbatim what has been remarked
before, but I am not attempting to shine in rounded
periods; but give every thing that occurs as it
comes to my knowledge: and this was the saying
of an Affghan gentleman, and also of several of the
lower classes, who came both to-day and often, to
see Sturt, to give him warnings, which, alas! were
by those in authority slighted.</p>

<p>A general opinion prevails amongst the Affghans
that a force will be sent up against them;
and many persons are getting letters to prove who
are our friends.</p>

<p>Macgregor writes that for reasons of the utmost
consequence, it is impossible for Sale's brigade to
leave Jellalabad. Yesterday there was a grand
discussion in the chiefs' durbar. One party objected
to the departure of the English, urging that,
<i>coute qui coute</i>, they should be killed: the Nawaub
Zeman Shah Khan said, "If that is your
opinion, I shall go into cantonments; after that,
do as you will: for me, I will never lend myself
to any act that is contrary to good faith." Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
friends in the city seem to think that this chief's
character is not understood by our chiefs in cantonments.
Zeman Shah Khan does not wish our
departure; but he fears his followers, and dares
not openly say what he thinks.</p>

<p>The Envoy, in taking the part of Mahommed
Akbar Khan, and in giving him money, has given
him the means of doing much harm. Before he
received money from us he had no power, and was
not a person of any consequence; now he is in
force, with the disadvantage of possessing a very
bad disposition; and until the Nawaub said, "if
you put difficulties in their route to Jellalabad I
shall go into cantonments," he did every thing
in his power to embarrass the council. At present,
all appears <i>couleur de rose</i>.</p>

<p>It is said that yesterday Mahommed Akbar
Khan went to Osman Khan's house, and swore on
the Koran that he would do whatever the Nawaub
desired. This act they say decided every thing;
and it was settled that the troops should march on
Tuesday the 4th, Osman Khan to go with the army;
he appears to be a good and an intelligent person.
The son of the Nawaub also goes, but he is not
considered a shining character, though a good
person. It is believed that Shah Shoojah will have
a strong party after the English depart; but the
Nawaub's faction treat this opinion with ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
<i>23d.</i>&mdash;Humza Khan is a Ghilzye chief, now in
Mahmood Khan's fort. He was the governor of
the Ghilzye country; and, when the insurrection
broke out in the end of September at Bhoodkhak,
he was sent by the King to suppress it: instead
of which he organised the rebel force.</p>

<p>On the return of this chief to Cabul he was
put in irons in prison, and was to have been sent
to the fortress of Ghuznee; he obtained his release
when the insurrection of the 2d of November
took place. This said Humza Khan has proffered
to the Envoy, for a large consideration, provisions,
if we will hold out; but his reputed bad character
for faith renders him perhaps unsafe to deal with:
besides, it may be a mere <i>ruse</i> to ascertain whether
we are sincere or not in regard to the treaty we
have made. There are said to be 2000 men in
Mahmood Khan's fort at present.</p>

<p>Our sick men were placed in doolies to-day,
preparatory to their removal to Zeman Shah
Khan's house in the city; but their departure was
delayed.</p>

<p>Some of our ammunition waggons were taken
away by the allies; as also shrapnell and eight-inch
shells.</p>

<p>Capt. Skinner came in at eleven last night with
two Affghans; one, I believe, was a half brother of
Mahommed Akbar's, by name Sultan Khan. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
one this morning they returned to the city on
important business. Moussa Khan was also sent
into the city early this morning on some affair
connected with negotiations.</p>

<p>The 54th, Shah's 6th, and some guns are ordered
for a secret service; which the staff officer
who gave the order said was to attack Mahmood
Khan's fort, and from thence to bring away
Amenoollah Khan, dead or alive. This force was
ordered on an especial requisition of the Envoy's:
I was present at mid-day, when Capt. Lawrence
told Capt. Boyd that he was to purchase any
quantity of grain and provision in his power, even
to the extent of fifty days' supplies; and if it was
not required, the loss would fall on the Government,
should we go away and leave it behind. This conversation
took place just previous to the Envoy
going out to meet Akbar Khan, on the plain between
the cantonments and the Siah Sung Hill.</p>

<p>I remarked that Lawrence styled the chiefs
rebels instead of allies; which, coupled with the
order to the commissariat officer to lay in provisions,
looked very suspicious.</p>

<p>About two o'clock we suddenly heard firing, and
all went to the rear gate to see what the matter
was; when I met Mr. Waller, who informed me
that the Envoy had been taken away by the
chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
The clearest account we have yet obtained was
from Le Geyt, who accompanied the Envoy. It
seems, when he arrived at the burnt bridge, the
Envoy sent back all his escort except ten men.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton having expressed a wish to be
present at the conference, and not having joined
the party, Le Geyt was sent back to hasten his
arrival. The Brigadier said he was occupied, and
could not go; and when Le Geyt returned it was
too late, and he met the escort, who said that
Lawrence and Mackenzie had ordered them back.</p>

<p>Many shots were fired, and some of them came
into cantonments. Le Geyt's saces, who had been
desired to remain when his master returned to
cantonments, now came up; and reported that on
the Envoy's arrival he found the chiefs seated on
a loonghee on the ground; that he sat there with
them and discoursed, whilst Trevor, Mackenzie,
and Lawrence remained on their horses; that
after a time two sirdars came, and stood behind
the Envoy, who rose, as did Akbar Khan; that
the Ghazeeas came and cut in between them and
the cantonments, and firing commenced; that one
of them drew Lawrence's sword from his side;
that Akbar Khan took the Envoy by the hand,
and led him, and all the gentlemen dismounted,
towards the Yaghi fort; but it is generally believed
that they are all safe, but taken into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
city; however, great anxiety prevails regarding
their fate, and that of Skinner, Conolly, and
Airey, who are in the city as hostages.</p>

<p>The regiments were got under arms, the walls
manned, &amp;c .; but nothing was done. Grant declared
that it was impossible to say whether it was a
piece of treachery on the part of the chiefs, or
friendship to save the party from an attack by the
Ghazeeas. The only certain thing is, that our
chiefs are at a non-plus.</p>

<p>The Affghans are greatly alarmed at a letter
they have intercepted from Major Leech, political
agent: this letter was of an old date, in which he
tells the Envoy to hold out, that reinforcements
are coming from Candahar, and that by hook or
by crook he will obtain other aid from Hindostan.</p>

<p>There is also a native report, that four regiments
are between this and Jellalabad. A cossid
has come in from Macgregor; where he has been
detained we know not; but the letters he brought
were of the 16th of November. There is a general
opinion in cantonments that faith has been broken
on both sides, and that the Affghans have made
the cleverest chupao.</p>

<p>Boyd has seven days' provisions; and says the
bazaar can furnish seven more.</p>

<p>The bridge is taken up at the rear gate, and
the camels that came in with grain have not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
allowed to go out again. Neither is egress permitted
to any respectable-looking Affghan who is
in cantonments. The Meerakhor (one of the hostages,
and the general go-between in our negotiations)
has promised to get a letter conveyed to
Sir William in the morning and to obtain a
reply: he says there are too many Ghazeeas
about to attempt it to-night.</p>

<p>The plain was at one time covered with people;
but the horsemen seemed wending up and down
trying to quiet them, and they gradually dispersed.</p>

<p>There was a great crowd about a body, which
the Affghans were seen to strip: it was evidently
that of an European; but, strange to say, no endeavour
was made to recover it, which might
easily have been done by sending out cavalry.</p>

<p>A red flag, said to be Amenoollah Khan's,
went with about thirty men to reinforce the
Rikabashees fort; and subsequently a greater
number.</p>

<p>The Magazine fort was crowded with men.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;I received a note from Lawrence, enclosing
one from Conolly (Sir William's nephew)
to Lady Macnaghten, and had the sad office
imposed on me of informing both her and Mrs.
Trevor of their husbands' assassination: over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
such scenes I draw a veil. It was a most painful
meeting to us all.</p>

<p>Numerous reports are current. That of to-day
is, that Sir William was taken to the city, and
arraigned before a tribunal there for want of
faith; and that Trevor suffered from the assiduity
with which he executed the Envoy's orders. All
reports agree, that both the Envoy's and Trevor's
bodies are hanging in the public chouk: the
Envoy's decapitated and a mere trunk; the limbs
having been carried in triumph about the city.</p>

<p>A fallen man meets but little justice; and reports
are rife that the Envoy was guilty of double-dealing,
treating with Akbar Khan and Amenoollah
Khan at the same time. In justice to a dead
man, it should be remembered that the only
person supposed to know the object of the Envoy's
going out on the 23d was Skinner; who is now
in the city. Sultan Khan was, I believe, the
name of the person who came in with him, with a
letter from Akbar Khan, on the night of the 22d.
In that letter, which was read by a friend of mine,
Akbar proposed that he should be made wuzeer to
Shah Shoojah; he was to receive thirty lakhs of
rupees, down, and four lakhs per annum: our
troops to remain eight months; and then only to
go if the King wished them to do so. He urgently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
requested the Envoy to come and talk it over
with him.</p>

<p>We must hold in mind that, although we had
performed all promises made on our part, given
up our waggons, ammunition, forts, &amp;c ., the
treaty had never been signed by the chiefs; nor
had they fulfilled a single condition which had
been specified verbally, beyond giving us grain in
small quantities. The sequitur is, that the Envoy
was perfectly justified, as far as keeping good faith
went, in entering into any arrangement by which
the condition of the troops could be ameliorated
and the honour of our country be insured. He only
erred in supposing it possible that Akbar Khan,
proverbially the most treacherous of all his countrymen,
could be sincere.</p>

<p>It was a part of Akbar Khan's plan to have
Amenoollah Khan seized and brought to cantonments
as a hostage.</p>

<p>It was a most decided piece of treachery on the
part of Akbar. They were seated on a bank together:
Lawrence, a very spunky active man,
felt as if something was wrong; and when urged to
sit, only knelt on one knee, that he might start
up on occasion: but his pistol and sword were
seized and his arms secured instantaneously, which
rendered him powerless, and he was hurried away
behind a chief on horseback; as was Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
At that time Mahommed Akbar Khan had seized
the Envoy by his left wrist, and Sultan Jan held
him by the right; they dragged him down the
bank, he exclaiming, "Az burai Kodar!" (For the
love of God!) At the moment he was laid hands
on, Mackenzie, Trevor, and Lawrence were disarmed,
and forced away <i>en croup</i> behind different
chiefs. They saw no more of the Envoy alive.
Sultan Jan uttering an opprobrious epithet, calling
him a dog, cut poor Trevor down, as did also
Moollah Momind. Mackenzie would have shared
the same fate had not Mahommed Shah Khan, behind
whom he rode, received the cut on his own
arm, which went through his postheen. Lawrence's
life was saved by hard galloping: but he
received some blows. This account I had from
the surviving principals in the tragedy; so it
may be depended on as the true account. The
body we saw from the rear gate was that of the
Envoy.</p>

<p>A letter has this day been received, signed by
several Kohistanees, of no great consequence,
setting forth that they do not care for either party;
that they can muster 400 men, and are ready for
a handsome consideration to escort us down safe
to Jellalabad. No notice was taken of this letter,
but the idea was laughed to scorn.</p>

<p>The original treaty between Sir William and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
the chiefs has been sent in again; with three additional
clauses:&mdash;</p>

<p>To leave all our treasure:</p>

<p>To leave all our guns excepting six:</p>

 <p>To exchange the present hostages for all the
 married men and their families; and General
 Sale's name particularly mentioned. No doubt he
 was not forgotten by Mahommed Shah Khan the
 Ghilzye, whom he defeated at Jellalabad, and 500
 of whose followers were killed.</p>

<p>General Elphinstone said he might give the
officers as hostages; but that their wives and families
were not public property: and, unless the
husbands consented, he could not send them.</p>

<p>Major Thain was accordingly sent round to ask
all the married officers if they would consent to
their wives staying; offering those who did so a
salary of 2000 rupees a month. Lieut. Eyre said
if it was to be productive of great good he would
stay with his wife and child. The others all refused
to risk the safety of their families. Capt.
Anderson said he would rather put a pistol to his
wife's head and shoot her; and Sturt, that his
wife and mother should only be taken at the point
of the bayonet: for himself, he was ready to perform
any duty imposed on him.</p>

<p>There certainly appears to have been a fatality
about the events of yesterday. I have mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
that Sir William applied to Gen. Elphinstone for two
regiments and two guns for a secret service, which
were in readiness, but never went out of cantonments:
had they done so, it is more than probable
that the surprise never would have occurred.
Added to this, with his usual vacillation, Gen. E.
wrote a note to the Envoy, which never reached
him, as it arrived at his house after his departure,
and was not even opened at the time. In this
note he stated that we were too weak to send two
regiments out of cantonments; particularly as the
magazine fort was now garrisoned by 400 men instead
of 40, the number the allies had stipulated
should be thrown into it: and that if two regiments
and two guns were to go out, the safety
of the cantonments would be endangered. The
Envoy had only ordered ten of his escort to attend
him. Lawrence had taken sixteen; but a
part of these returned of their own accord, feigning
orders from Lawrence and Mackenzie. They
probably had some knowledge of what was in contemplation;
for there can be no doubt that the
Envoy was surrounded by spies and traitors. Persian
notes, that have arrived, have on different occasions
been offered for perusal by his chuprassies&mdash;who
were unable to read themselves, and anxious
to know the contents&mdash;to Capt. Trevor's elder boys,
who could read the characters; but they, imagining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
it was pure curiosity, and having no turn of a diplomatic
description, refused to read them; and the
notes were probably taken to others who did so, and
made bad use of what intelligence they contained.</p>

<p>As it appears extremely uncertain whether we
shall get on with the treaty or not, we are busy
making up hammocks to carry the sick. They are
making up in Sturt's compound; so light that two
men can carry a heavy man in one easily.</p>

<p>Reports are assiduously spread that the Envoy's
and Trevor's deaths were the act of the Ghazeeas;
and that Mahommed Akbar Khan greatly regrets
all that has passed.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;A dismal Christmas-day, and our situation
far from cheering. A letter brought in from
Conolly to say, that the Nawaub Zeman Khan had
interested himself greatly in the cause; and had
procured the two bodies to be stolen, and that
they hoped to be able to send them in at night.
Trevor's had not been mutilated. It appears probable
that the Envoy's death was not contemplated.
Akbar wished to seize him, in hopes, by making
him a hostage, to obtain better terms: but he is a
man of violent passions; and, being thwarted, the
natural ferocity of his disposition was evinced.</p>

<p>At night there was some firing, and the bugles
sounded: all went to their respective posts, but
the party of about 200 Affghans went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
There was evidently great commotion in the city
at the same time.</p>

<p>A cossid came in from Jellalabad; but no news
later than the 7th.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;The bodies were not sent in. The city
is in great excitement; the Affghans fearing we
shall not make the treaty good and force our way
down.</p>

<p>It seems that the original treaty insured to the
chiefs thirteen lakhs of rupees; and they insist on
having it paid; not, as was stipulated, on our safe
arrival at Peshawer, but to be given now in bills
on Government, which there are people here who
will cash for them on the spot. We are to be
allowed to keep six yaboo loads of treasure; and
all the rest is to be given to them before we go;
or else the chiefs fear they will not get it, as their
people would <i>loot</i> it all.</p>

<p>However, we are informed that the chiefs do
not mean to keep faith; and that it is their intention
to get all our women into their possession;
and to kill every man except one, who is to have
his hands and legs cut off, and is to be placed
with a letter <i>in terrorem</i> at the entrance of the
Khyber passes, to deter all Feringhees from entering
the country again. A Persian note, without
signature or address, was brought by a common-looking
man to the officer on duty at the rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
gate; giving information that the cantonments are
to be attacked to-night. We have also information
that the road to Jellalabad is clear; as the Ghilzyes
are all come into Cabul to exterminate us and <i>loot</i>
the cantonments.</p>

<p>The chiefs wish to force us to go down by
another route, where our people say we are sure
to be opposed.</p>

<p>Letters received from Capt. Mackeson, P. A. at
Peshawer, state that the advance with ammunition
had reached Peshawer, and the 16th Lancers, the
9th, and 31st, were close behind: it is, however,
impossible that they can arrive here in time to
save us from either a disgraceful treaty, or a disastrous
retreat.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;The Council&mdash;Elphinstone, Shelton,
Anquetil, and Chambers, with Major Pottinger&mdash;have
ratified the treaty. No one but themselves
exactly knows what this same treaty is; further
than that it is most disgraceful! 14½ lakhs
to be given for our safe conduct to Peshawer;
all our guns to be given up save six; and six
hostages to be given on our part; and when they
are sent Lawrence and Mackenzie are to return.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Lawrence has come in, looking haggard
and ten years older from anxiety. It appears that
the Envoy, when Mahommed Akbar Khan took
hold of him, grappled with him and threw him on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
the ground. Akbar fired his pistol at him, and
wounded him; and afterwards he was cut to pieces.</p>

<p>There has been great excitement in the city.
Khan Shereen Khan refused to attend the Durbar;
and Akbar's conduct has been generally condemned
by the chiefs.</p>

<p>Naïb Shureef paid for the interment of Sir A.
Burnes's body; but it was never buried; and part
of it, cut into many pieces, is still hanging on the
trees in his garden.</p>

<p>The Envoy's head is kept in a bhoossa bag in
the chouk: and Akbar says he will send it to
Bokhara; to show to the king there how he has
seized the Feringhees here, and what he means to
do to them.</p>

<p>Our guns are brought down to the gate, to be
ready for the Affghans to carry off to-morrow.</p>

<p>Conolly, Airy, and Skinner are in the city;
and Warburton, Walsh, and Webb have been
sent as the other three hostages, to make up the
number, although the treaty is not yet signed
by the chiefs. There is much doubt whether
Mackenzie will be given up to us.</p>

<p>It was reported that the Meer Wallee of
Khoolloom was expected with reinforcements to
Akbar to-day; but we have not heard whether he
has arrived or not.</p>

<p>Many routes have been named for our downward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
march this morning. We were to go by
Zoormut; but I believe we still go by Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Amenoollah Khan is now represented as our
best friend amongst the chiefs.</p>

<p>Whether we go by treaty or not, I fear but
few of us will live to reach the provinces.</p>

<p>Although there is plenty of carriage for the
sick, it is to-day decided that they are to be
left behind; and the medical men drew lots who
were to stay: they fell upon Primrose of the
44th, and Campbell of the Company's service:
the former exchanged with Dr. Berwick, the late
Envoy's medical staff, who, with Mr. Campbell of
the 54th, are to go to the city with the sick
men.</p>

<p>Snow all day.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Mackenzie and Skinner came in, in
handsome dresses presented to them by Mahommed
Akbar Khan, who professed to them he had no
hand in the Envoy's death; and, to prove his sincerity,
wept for two hours.</p>

<p>Brig. Shelton has again had recourse to Mahommed
Akbar; and has obtained carriage from
him.</p>

<p>It is said it was the Envoy's intention to have
superseded Gen. Elphinstone, had Gen. Nott
arrived: but no such measure would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
requisite, as the General had summoned Nott to
take the command, and had, in fact, given it over
to him from the 1st of November: so that it is a
point to speculate upon as to who is our military
chief; and whether, under existing circumstances,
Gen. Elphinstone is empowered to treat with the
chiefs regarding the troops.</p>

<p>To give an instance of the strange way in
which matters are conducted here: Serg. Deane
came and reported to Sturt that he had received
orders to slope the banks of the canal, &amp;c ., without
any reference to Sturt; who, of course, ordered his
sergeants not to undertake any work without his
orders. Sloping these banks would facilitate the
passage of the enemy; who otherwise must cross
the canal at the usual spots, either the ford or
bridge.</p>

<p>Our sick sent to the city.</p>

<p>Snow all day.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;500 Ghazeeas made a rush at the rear
gate; and only desisted on finding the port-fire
ready, which would have sent grape in amongst
them. In revenge, they tore up the small bridge
over the canal.</p>

<p>More of our guns were sent to the chiefs, who
now dictate to us, delaying our departure, which
is to be postponed according to their pleasure.</p>

<p>More sick men sent to the city to-day. As the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
camels and doolies that conveyed them there returned,
they were attacked and plundered; the men
were stripped, and had to run for their lives without
any clothing, their black bodies conspicuous
as they ran over the snow. The doolies and
camels were all carried off. One of the hostages
has written to me, dated midnight of the 29th,
and tells me that they are all well in the city, and
that, from the appearance of affairs, we shall most
likely go down unmolested: that the Nawaub
Zeman Khan is very kind; and he or one of his
sons is with them nearly all day: the room they
inhabit is eighteen feet by ten, and all the hostages
are together: it is very uncomfortable, being thus
confined; this, however, must be the case for some
time: even the courtyard below is not free from
vagabonds. The night the Envoy was killed the
Ghazeeas rushed even up to the door, determined
on Conolly's and Airy's death; and it was difficult
to get rid of them. The poor Envoy's hand was
held up to the window, to show it to Conolly!
Ameenoollah Khan seems to be well pleased.
The King went to them the night the letter was
written, and took his musicians with him, who
played and sang till eleven o'clock: he is represented
as a most fatherly old gentleman. This
alludes to Zeman Shah Khan, and not to Shah
Shoojah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
The Nawaub's second son, Soojah ool Dowlah,
is to go down with us: he is represented as a
very nice fellow, about twenty-two years old.
A postscript, added this morning, informs me
that the chiefs are very well pleased; and do
not wish us to go till all our arrangements are
comfortably made, for their suspicions are now at
an end.</p>

<p>Sturt received instructions from Capt. Bellew
to scarp the banks of the canal, by way of rendering
them easier for the camels to get over. "To
slope, I suppose you mean?" said Sturt. "You may
suppose what you please," replied Bellew; "but
the General's orders sent by me are, to scarp the
banks;&mdash;and now do as you like: and you are also
to cut the rampart down, to make a free passage
for the troops; as, there being but one gateway on
the face, it would take a long time for the troops
and baggage to pass out."</p>

<p>When Sturt was first desired by the General
to cut an opening, he proposed making two of
twelve feet each, with twenty feet between: this
was objected to, as being too small; and he then
said he would throw down the rampart between,
which would make an opening of forty-four feet:
but of course such a breach (for the rampart was
to be thrown in to fill the ditch, twenty feet wide)
was a work only to be undertaken at the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
hour; unless the General could give guns and
additional troops to defend it.</p>

<p>In consequence of these messages, Sturt wrote
to Grant to say, that unless we were to start instanter
after the breach was made, or the General
had the necessary means for its defence, it would
risk the safety of the cantonments; particularly
after what had occurred this morning. Grant, by
the General's desire, wrote to know what did
occur; and then Sturt wrote an account of the
attack of the Ghazeeas at the rear gate, our cattle
having been carried off and the bearers plundered,
&amp;c .: upon this Grant, by the General's desire,
wrote to say they did not know any of the circumstances;
and begged nothing might be done
to injure our defences.</p>

<p>Snow all day.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31st.</i>&mdash;The chiefs say they have no control
over the Ghazeeas; that when they offend we
may fire on them; that they will have the camels,
taken from us yesterday, restored.</p>

<p>Now did they give us even camel for camel, it
would be another matter: but, instead of that,
fifteen of the worst of our own were brought back
out of thirty-six; and a present of 100 rupees was
made to them for the trouble they had taken.</p>

<p>This morning a number of camels laden with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
grain, &amp;c . were plundered close to the rear gate.
Verbal orders were sent by Brig. Shelton to fire
on these people if absolutely requisite: but no
written order to that effect has been given, and no
one will take the responsibility upon his own
shoulders. No orders of any import are transmitted
in writing. Some one, any one, is sent, with
a verbal message to the officer it concerns; and, if
any thing goes wrong, what has he to show as his
authority for acting as he has done? Amongst
other orders, there is one not actually to fire, but
to make believe they are going to do so; which has
occasioned some ridiculous and harmless flourishes
of port-fires.</p>

<p>There is still negotiation going on; and there
seems to be some hints regarding Shah Shoojah's
abdication. The Affghans do not wish to put him
to death, but only to deprive him of sight.</p>

<p>The chiefs are, we hear, to come into Mahmood
Khan's fort with a large force to-morrow, to be
ready to protect cantonments, and we are to march
out the next day.</p>

<p>Thus ends the year. The bodies of the Envoy
and Trevor have not been brought in; and we hope
that the Nawaub Zeman Khan may be able to get
them privately interred in his own garden.</p>

<p>Sergeant Williams, who died in consequence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
his wound, was placed in the coffin and buried in
the grave prepared for the Envoy behind the
barracks.</p>

<p>Snow has lain on the ground since the 18th of
December.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 1st, 1842.</i>&mdash;The Naïb Meer came in:
negotiations are still going on.</p>

<p>The Nawaub Zeman Shall Khan and Osman
Khan appear to be honourable men; as also Mahommed
Shah Khan Ghilzye: the former, or his
son, sits with the hostages day and night to insure
their protection. The latter is the person who received
the sword-cut on his arm intended for
Mackenzie, and thereby saved his life, on the 23d
of last month.</p>

<p>A party of fifty Affghan workmen, magnified
by the General into 500, have been sent to work
on the banks of the canal: they soon said they
were cold and tired, and would finish the rest to-morrow.</p>

<p>Two men came in to-day with a Koran to
Sergeant Deane (who, from having an Affghan
wife, has many acquaintances and friends amongst
the people of Cabul): they report that Mahommed
Akbar Khan is false; that 10,000 Kohistanees are
to attack us at Tézeen, and all the Ghilzyes at
Soorkhab.</p>

<p>Offers have been made of provisions; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
suspected that it is only to try our faith, and see
if we will lay in provisions on the sly.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;Before breakfast Sturt received the following
note from Gen. Elphinstone:&mdash;</p>

 <p>"Dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we to have the Affghan Bhildars
 again to-day? If so, they had better be employed
 on the other side of the river. Pottinger proposes
 our taking on the planks to cross the streams in
 the Khoord Cabul pass. He says 250 planks
 would do. He will explain this to you after
 breakfast. Let me hear what was done yesterday.
 We shall march on Tuesday, I think: that
 is the present arrangement. You must settle with
 Boyd about the bullocks for the bridge, which we
 must take on to the Loghur.</p>

 <p class="yours">"Yours,<br />"W. R. E."</p>

<p class="gap-above">There have been so many clever propositions
during the siege, that, if I succeed in saving my
papers, many of the original letters will require to
be appended, to prove that I do not use the
traveller's privilege! To-day's is this. We make
a bridge to cross the Cabul river; and carry on
planks to the Loghur, in case that bridge should
have been destroyed. Major Pottinger proposes
that we carry 250 planks, to be laid down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Khoord Cabul, for crossing the streams, which
occur on an average every 100 yards. Could
we afford transport for these planks, the delay
occasioned would render the journey through that
pass one of about three days, as the stream is
crossed about thirty times. One word regarding
the carriage of these said planks. A camel would
only carry two; thus, 125 animals would be required;
and we are unable to take the requisite
quantity of ammunition, for want of carriage.
Besides, why is this stream not to be frozen, as it
is but a few inches deep any where?</p>

<p>There appears to be much commotion amongst
the chiefs regarding the Envoy's death, and Akbar's
conduct; who still repeats that he did not
kill the Envoy, but that it was done by the Ghazeeas.
He threatens to attack us on the road; and
Osman Khan says if he does he will fight him all
the way down, taking, as his own party, 1000
horse and 500 foot.</p>

<p>Aziz Khan is to be at Soorkhab ready to exterminate
us. We hear from the city that Sale has
been taking forts, carrying off women and provisions,
and greatly annoying the good people
about Jellalabad.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;The march, which was fixed for to-day, is
again postponed. The Kohistanees have not
received any part of the money given to the chiefs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
They have sent an agent to Sturt to say that, if
we wish it, they will bring the chiefs of Kardurrah
into cantonments, with four others, as hostages;
that we need not give them any money now, they
know that we have none, and are content with our
promise. They wish us to remain quiet. They
will give us provisions; and attack and fire Cabul
within three days. They will also go down and
bring up reinforcements for us from Jellalabad.
They assure us that the chiefs are false, and mean
to attack us on the road. All this was represented
to our chiefs by Sturt. The reply he
received was, "It was better to keep the matter
quiet; as in the present state of things it might, if
known, cause excitement."</p>

<p>Shah Shoojah is said to have a strong party:
and all the roads leading to the Bala Hissar are
watched, to prevent persons joining him; though
Nooreddin has succeeded in doing so, with twenty
followers.</p>

<p>The 40,000 rupees given by us to the chiefs, to
raise 2000 men, at twenty rupees each, to protect
us to Jellalabad, have not succeeded. They have
kept the money, of course; but say they cannot get
men to go at this season; and even if they could,
the chiefs cannot afford to weaken their party by
sending their followers away.</p>

<p>The thermometer to-day at sunrise was below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
zero; in the sitting room, with an enormous
blazing fire, at noon, 40°. Yesterday, with the
same good fire, at 9 <small>A.M.</small>, 11°.</p>

<p>Another excellent project of Major Pottinger's.
Among our various vacillatory measures, there
is again a thought, now that the time for action
is long past, to force our way into the Bala Hissar:
but how are we to get our ammunition in?
Erect a battery on the Siah Sung Hill (of course
to be the work of fairies during the night), fire
our shot from cantonments into the battery,
where of course guardian sylphs would protect
the lives of our men, who were quickly to pick
them up, and send them on, in like manner, into
the Bala Hissar! No arrangement made for
transporting the powder. The tale was told from
where the conversation had taken place&mdash;at the
General's. The narrator was Capt. Bellew. Both
Sturt and I taxed him with joking; but he
assured us it was all true, and only another of the
many strange events constantly occurring. Then
ensued a long parley and military discussion on
the point, its feasibility, and its having been tried
in some peninsular warfare. But I never could
get Bellew to explain how our men's lives in the
battery were to be saved.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;I heard from Sale, dated 19th December.
He acknowledged the receipt of my note, giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
an account of operations up to the 9th instant.
He was doubly anxious relative to our situation,
from having heard only the day before that the
Kandahar troops were near us, and all the cossids
telling those at Jellalabad that we had plenty of
provisions; and he still trusts in God that the
Kandahar force may arrive in time to save us;
and prevent the necessity of terms disgraceful to
our reputation in India. He informs me of the
arrival of the advanced guard of our cavalry at
Peshawer with ammunition; and that the 3d
Buffs and 9th Foot had marched; with altogether
six regiments of N. I., and some artillery, sappers,
and engineer officers. The news from
Cabul had not then had any effect on the chiefs
about Jellalabad, whose followers are daily diminishing.
Our troops were, nevertheless, as hard
at work as ever, making the place as strong as
possible. At that time Mackeson had not sent
them any money; of which they were in great
want, not having a rupee to give to the troops,
and three months' pay nearly due. Extracts from
my letter had been sent to Government and to the
Commander-in-Chief. The original has been sent
to my son-in-law, Capt. Bund; as Sale writes me
that no other person gives them any idea of our
real position at Cabul.</p>

<p>The Affghans still tell us we are doomed; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
warn us to be particularly cautious of our safety in
going out of cantonments. Taj Mahommed says
that Mrs. Sturt and I must wear neemchees over
our habits&mdash;common leather ones&mdash;and turbans,
and ride mixed in with the suwars; not to go in
palkees or keep near the other ladies, as they
are very likely to be attacked.</p>

<p>The chiefs are to come in to-morrow to take
charge of cantonments before we leave them. Nawaub
Zeman Shah Khan is also to come in to see
the General.</p>

<p>Orders for the first bugle at 6, the second at 7.
Sturt inquired if he was to make the breach, and,
when made, who were to guard it, &amp;c .: to which
the following is the reply:&mdash;</p>

 <p>"My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>"If it is as well as before, the General
 thinks you need not turn out the sappers. The
 Brigadier says you are the best judge as to whether
 it is defensible or not.</p>

 <p class="yours">"Yours truly,<br />"<span class="smcap">Wm. Thain</span>.</p>

 <p class="nodent">"4th Jan. 7 <small>P.M.</small></p>

 <p>"The General wants to know if the planks which
 were sent have been removed. The troops are
 not to turn out at 6 in the morning as ordered, but
 wait till further orders.</p>

 <p class="yours"><br />"W. T."</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
<i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;Sturt employed in making the
breach. The chiefs say we shall go to-morrow.
Orders out for 7 and 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Shah Shoojah has sent a message to ask if not
even one officer of his force will stand by him.
This message was, I know, delivered by Sturt
himself to several; but circumstances admitted not
of their further adherence. Indeed it is more than
doubtful that the King was at the bottom of the
insurrection, never dreaming that it would go so
far.</p>

<h3>THE RETREAT FROM CABUL.</h3>

<p><i>Thursday, 6th January, 1842.</i>&mdash;We marched
from Cabul. The advanced guard consisted of
the 44th Queen's, 4th Irregular Horse, and Skinner's
Horse, two H. A. six-pounder guns, Sappers
and Miners, Mountain Train, and the late Envoy's
escort. The main body included the 5th and
37th N. I.; the latter in charge of treasure; Anderson's
Horse, the Shah's 6th Regiment, two H. A.
six-pounder guns. The rear guard was composed
of the 54th N. I., 5th Cavalry, and two six-pounder
H. A. guns. The force consisted of about 4500
fighting men, and 12,000 followers.</p>

<p>The troops left cantonments both by the rear
gate and the breach to the right of it, which had
been made yesterday by throwing down part of
the rampart to form a bridge over the ditch. All
was confusion from before daylight. The day
was clear and frosty; the snow nearly a foot deep
on the ground; the thermometer considerably
below freezing point.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock a great part of the baggage
was outside the cantonments. It was fully expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
that we would have to fight our way out
of them, although terms had been entered into
with the Sirdar for our safe escort. Bills were
granted on India for fourteen and a half lakhs of
rupees, by the political authority (Major Pottinger)
to the Cabul Shroffs, to be paid to the following
Sirdars, who were, on their part, to protect
the force as far as Peshawer:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mahommed Zeman Shah Khan, three lakhs:</p>

<p>Amenoollah Khan, six lakhs:</p>

<p>Khan Shireen Khan, head of the Kuzzilbashes, two lakhs:</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan, one lakh:</p>

<p>Osman Khan, two lakhs:</p>

<p>The Ghilzye chiefs, half a lakh.</p>

<p>We started at about half-past nine <small>A.M.</small> The
advance party were not molested; there might
have been 50 or 100 Affghans collected about the
gateway to witness our departure. The ladies,
collectively speaking, were placed with the advance,
under the charge of the escort; but Mrs.
Sturt and I rode up to Capt. Hay, and mixed
ourselves with his troopers.</p>

<p>The progress was very slow; for the first mile
was not accomplished under two and a half hours.
There was only one small bridge over the Nullah,
which is eight feet broad, but deep, situated
about fifty yards from cantonments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
Great stress had been laid on the necessity of a
bridge over the Cabul river, about half a mile
from cantonments. In vain had Sturt represented
over and over again, that as the river was perfectly
fordable, it was a labour of time and inutility:
with snow a foot deep, the men must get
their feet wet. However, as usual, every sensible
proposition was overruled; and Sturt was sent
long before daylight to make the bridge with gun
carriages. They could not be placed over-night,
as the Affghans would have carried them off: he
had therefore to work for hours up to his hips
in water, with the comfortable assurance that,
when his unprofitable task was finished, he could
not hope for dry clothes until the end of the
march; and immediately on quitting the water they
were all frozen stiff. I do not mention this as an
individual grievance, but to show the inclemency
of the weather, and the general misery sustained.</p>

<p>The bullocks had great difficulty in dragging
these gun-carriages through the snow, and when
the bridge was made it was proved to be an
unnecessary expense of time and labour. The
baggage might have forded the river with great
ease, a little above the bridge, where it was not
deep. Mrs. Sturt and I rode with the horsemen
through the river, in preference to attempting
the rattling bridge of planks laid across the gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
carriages: but the camp followers determined
not to go through the water, and jostled for their
turns to go over the bridge. This delay was the
origin of the day's misfortune, which involved
the loss of nearly all the baggage, and the greater
part of the commissariat stores.</p>

<p>The troops had been on half rations during the
whole of the siege: they consisted of half a seer
of wheat per diem, with melted ghee or dhal, for
fighting men; and for camp followers, for some
time, of a quarter of a seer of wheat or barley. Our
cattle, public and private, had long subsisted on
the twigs and bark of the trees. From the commencement
of negotiations with the chiefs, otta,
barley, and bhoosa were brought in in considerable
quantities; the former selling at from
two to four seers per rupee, and the latter from
seven to ten; but neither ourselves nor our servants
benefited by this arrangement: it came to
the commissariat for the troops. The poorer
camp followers had latterly subsisted on such
animals (camels, ponies, &amp;c .) as had died from
starvation. The men had suffered much from
over work and bad feeding, also from want of
firing; for when all the wood in store was expended,
the chiefs objected to our cutting down
any more of the fruit trees; and their wishes
were complied with. Wood, both public and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
private, was stolen: when ours was gone, we
broke up boxes, chests of drawers, &amp;c .; and our
last dinner and breakfast at Cabul were cooked
with the wood of a mahogany dining table.</p>

<p>When the advance had proceeded about a mile,
an order was brought for a return to cantonments,
as Mahommed Zeman Shah Khan had
written to say the chiefs were not ready; but
shortly afterwards a counter order arrived to
proceed without loss of time.</p>

<p>When the rear guard left cantonments, they
were fired upon from the cantonment then filled
with Affghans. The servants, who were not concerned
in the plunder, all threw away their loads,
and ran off. Private baggage, commissariat, and
ammunition were nearly annihilated at one fell
swoop. The whole road was covered with men,
women, and children, lying down in the snow
to die.</p>

<p>The only baggage we saved was Mrs. Sturt's
bedding, on which the ayah rode; and keeping
her close to us, it was saved.</p>

<p>The Mission Compound was first vacated: and
when the force from thence came into cantonments
in order to pass through them, it was
immediately filled with Affghans; who, in like
manner, occupied the cantonments as our troops
went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
It was the General's original intention to halt
at Begramee, close to the Loghur river, and about
five miles from Cabul (reiterated was the advice of
our Affghan friends&mdash;alas, how little heeded!&mdash;to
push on at all risks through the Khoord Cabul
the first day): but the whole country being
a swamp encrusted with ice, we went on about a
mile further, and halted at about 4 <small>P.M.</small> There
were no tents, save two or three small palls that
arrived. All scraped away the snow as best they
might, to make a place to lie down on. The
evening and night were intensely cold: no food
for man or beast procurable, except a few handfuls
of bhoosa, for which we paid from five to
ten rupees. Captain Johnson, in our great distress,
kindly pitched a small pall over us: but it
was dark, and we had few pegs; the wind blew in
under the sides, and I felt myself gradually stiffening.
I left the bedding, which was occupied
by Mrs. Sturt and her husband, and doubled up
my legs in a straw chair of Johnson's, covering
myself with my poshteen. Mr. Mein and the
ayah fully occupied the remainder of the space.
We only went in all six miles, and had to abandon
two H. A. guns on the road: we were also much
delayed by the bullocks that dragged the planks,
in case the Loghur bridge should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
destroyed. We had, however, positive information
that it was all right; and so it proved.</p>

<p>Previous to leaving cantonments, as we must
abandon most of our property, Sturt was anxious
to save a few of his most valuable books, and to
try the experiment of sending them to a friend in
the city. Whilst he selected these, I found,
amongst the ones thrown aside, Campbell's Poems,
which opened at Hohenlinden; and, strange to say,
one verse actually haunted me day and night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="misc">

<ul>
  <li>"Few, few shall part where many meet,</li>
  <li>The snow shall be their winding sheet;</li>
  <li>And every turf beneath their feet</li>
  <li>Shall be a soldier's sepulchre."</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>I am far from being a believer in presentiments;
but this verse is never absent from my thoughts.
Heaven forbid that our fears should be realized!
but we have commenced our retreat so badly, that
we may reasonably have our doubts regarding the
finale. Nearly all Hopkins's corps, the Shah's
6th, deserted from this place; as also the Shah's
sappers and miners, 250 in number.</p>

<p>We afterwards heard that 400 of Hopkins's
men went back to Cabul the next day.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday's rear-guard did not get up to
our bivouac till two this morning, as there was
no attempt to form any lines. As stragglers came
up we heard them shouting out, to know where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
their corps were; and the general reply,&mdash;that no
one knew any thing about it.</p>

<p>During last night, or rather towards the morning,
there was an alarm. Had it proved the
enemy, we were perfectly defenceless; fortunately
it was only camp followers, &amp;c .</p>

<p>At daylight we found several men frozen to
death, amongst whom was Mr. Conductor Macgregor.</p>

<p>The reason the rear-guard were so late was,
that they did not leave cantonments till sunset.
Previous to their quitting them the Affghans had
entered; and set fire to all the public and private
buildings, after plundering them of their contents.
The whole of our valuable magazine was <i>looted</i>
by the mob; and they burned the gun-carriages
to procure the iron. Some fighting took place
between the Affghans and our Sipahees. About
fifty of the 54th were killed and wounded; and
Cornet Hardyman, of the 5th Cavalry, killed.
A great deal of baggage and public property
was abandoned in cantonments, or lost on the
road; amongst which were two Horse Artillery
six-pounders, as before mentioned.</p>

<p>The officers of the rear-guard report that the
road is strewn with baggage; and that numbers of
men, women, and children, are left on the road-side
to perish. Captain Boyd's office accounts, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
amount of several lakhs of rupees, have been
lost.</p>

<p>Two or three small tents came up to-day.</p>

<p>The men were half-frozen; having bivouacked
all night in the snow, without a particle of food
or bedding, or wood to light a fire.</p>

<p>At half-past seven the advance-guard moved
off&mdash;no order was given&mdash;no bugle sounded.
It had much difficulty in forcing its way ahead of
the baggage and camp followers; all of whom had
proceeded in advance as soon as it was light.
Amongst them there were many Sipahees; and
discipline was clearly at an end. If asked why
they were not with their corps, one had a lame
foot, another could not find his regiment, another
had lost his musket: any excuse to run off.</p>

<p>The whole of what little baggage was left, was
not off the ground ere the enemy appeared, and
plundered all they could lay their hands on.</p>

<p>As the mountain train, consisting of three
three-pounders dragged by yaboos and mules,
was passing a small fort close to our back-ground,
a party of Affghans sallied out, and captured the
whole. Scarcely any resistance was offered on
the part of our troops, and the saces immediately
absconded. Brig. Anquetil and Lieut. Green
rallied the men, and retook the guns; but were
obliged to abandon them, as the 44th, whose duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
it was to guard them, very precipitately <i>made
themselves scarce</i>: but this was not done until
Anquetil and Green had spiked them with their
own hands, amid the gleaming sabres of the
enemy.</p>

<p>As the troops advanced on their road, the
enemy increased considerably on both flanks; and
greatly annoyed the centre and rear.</p>

<p>It was the General's intention to proceed
through the Khoord Cabul pass to Khoord Cabul;
and as it was not above one <small>P.M.</small> when the advance
arrived at Bhoodkhak, having only come
five miles, it was with dismay we heard the order
to halt.</p>

<p>We left Cabul with five and a half days' rations
to take us to Jellalabad, and no forage for
cattle, nor hope of procuring any on the road. By
these unnecessary halts we diminished our provisions;
and having no cover for officers or men,
they are perfectly paralysed with the cold. The
snow was more than a foot deep. Here, again, did
evil counsel beset the General: his principal
officers and staff objecting to a further advance;
and Capt. Grant, in whom he had much confidence,
assured him that if he proceeded he risked
the safety of the army!</p>

<p>On our arrival at Bhoodkhak, the enemy had
very greatly increased around our position; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
we heard that Mahommed Akbar Khan was with
them. Scarcely any baggage of either officers or
men now remained. In a very small pall of Johnson's
we slept nine, all touching each other.</p>

<p>We were also indebted to Johnson and Troup
for food. They had a few Cabul cakes and some
tea, which they kindly shared with us.</p>

<p>During this short march we were obliged to
spike and abandon two other six-pounders, the
horses not having strength sufficient to drag them
on. We have only two horse artillery guns left,
with scarcely any ammunition.</p>

<p>Again no ground was marked out for the troops.
Three fourths of the Sipahees are mixed up with
the camp followers, and know not where to find
the headquarters of their corps.</p>

<p>Snow still lies a foot deep on the ground. No
food for man or beast; and even water from the
river close at hand difficult to obtain, as our people
were fired on in fetching it.</p>

<p>Numbers of unfortunates have dropped, benumbed
with cold, to be massacred by the enemy:
yet, so bigoted are our rulers, that we are still
told that the Sirdars are faithful, that Mahommed
Akbar Khan is our friend!!! &amp;c . &amp;c . &amp;c .; and
the reason they wish us to delay is, that they may
send their troops to clear the passes for us! That
they will send them there can be no doubt; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
every thing is occurring just as was foretold to us
before we set out.</p>

<p>Between Begramee and Bhoodkhak, a body
of the enemy's horse charged down into the
column (immediately after the 5th and 37th
had passed); and succeeded in carrying off an
immense quantity of baggage and a number
of camels, without experiencing the least resistance.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;At sunrise no order had been issued for
the march, and the confusion was fearful. The
force was perfectly disorganised, nearly every man
paralysed with cold, so as to be scarcely able to
hold his musket or move. Many frozen corpses
lay on the ground. The Sipahees burnt their
caps, accoutrements, and clothes to keep themselves
warm. Some of the enemy appearing in
rear of our position, the whole of the camp followers
rushed to the front; every man, woman, and
child, seizing all the cattle that fell in their way,
whether public or private. The ground was strewn
with boxes of ammunition, plate, and property of
various kinds. A cask of spirits on the ground was
broached by the artillerymen, and, no doubt, by
other Europeans. Had the whole been distributed
fairly to the men, it would have done them good:
as it was, they became too much excited.</p>

<p>The enemy soon assembled in great numbers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
Had they made a dash at us, we could have
offered no resistance, and all would have been
massacred.</p>

<p>After very great exertions on the part of commanding
officers, portions of their corps were got
together. The 44th, headed by Major Thain,
drove the enemy off to a short distance, and took
up a position on a commanding height. The
cavalry were also employed. Bullets kept whizzing
by us, as we sat on our horses, for hours.
The artillerymen were now fully <i>primed</i>, by having
had some brandy given them from the
54th's mess stores, which were being distributed
to any one who would take them. They mounted
their horses; and, with the best feeling in the
world, declared that they were ashamed at our
inactivity, and vowed they would charge the
enemy. Capt. Nicholl, their immediate commandant,
came up; abused them as drunkards, and
talked of punishment: not the way, under such
circumstances, to quiet tipsy men. They turned
to Sturt shortly after their own officer had left
them, having showered curses and abuse on them,
which had irritated them dreadfully. Sturt told
them they were fine fellows, and had ever proved
themselves such during the siege; but that their
lives were too valuable to be risked at such a
moment: but, if need were, and their services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
were required, he would himself go with them.
This, in a certain degree, restrained their ardour;
yet still they kept on talking valiantly. These
men listened the more readily to Sturt because
they knew him well: he was daily and hourly in
the batteries with them, encouraging them by
being ever the foremost in the post of danger; and
on those dreadfully cold nights during the siege,
whilst there was a bottle of brandy to be had at
any price, after his own small store was expended,
he gave those men on duty each one glass to
warm and cheer them&mdash;a comfort they fully appreciated,
as they had long been without what
was now become necessary, though it is in general
the soldier's bane. For myself, whilst I sat for
hours on my horse in the cold, I felt very grateful
for a tumbler of sherry, which at any other time
would have made me very unlady-like, but now
merely warmed me, and appeared to have no more
strength in it than water. Cups full of sherry
were given to young children three and four years
old without in the least affecting their heads.</p>

<p>When Major Thain took command of the 44th,
he took part of the 37th N. I. with him. The
44th lines were nearest to the men who were
firing into our camp; which was only saved by the
promptness of Thain and Lawrence, who brought
up the escort at a trot in the direction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
firing. He had to pass to the right of the 44th,
and there he found about 150 of that regiment
falling into their ranks. Major Thain was about
200 yards in advance, apparently reconnoitring the
enemy, who were creeping up under cover of the
ravines and hillocks, and keeping up a desultory
fire on our camp. About this time a company of
the 37th N. I. formed on Lawrence's right, and
on Thain making a signal all moved forward, and
drove off the enemy in good style. Anderson's
horse were formed on the opposite face of the
camp, with orders to keep back the camp followers,
who were rushing towards the entrance of the
pass. Major Thain appears to have acted on the
spur of the moment; which is the only reason I
can assign for his commanding the 44th. Lawrence
was not under any one's orders; as the General,
before quitting cantonments, told him that his
escort would be an independent body.</p>

<p>I am by no means certain that our chiefs pursued
the wisest course. Had they, when the enemy
first appeared, showed a good front, and dashed at
them, they would probably all have scampered off
as fast as they could. The Affghans never stand
a charge.</p>

<p>The General and Major Pottinger soon discovered
that Mahommed Akbar Khan was there,
and entered into communication with him: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
agreed to protect the troops, on condition that he
should receive hereafter 15,000 rupees; and that
Pottinger, Lawrence, and Mackenzie should be
given over to him as hostages for General Sale's
evacuation of Jellalabad; but that the troops should
not proceed further than Tézeen until information
be received of the march of the troops from that
place. These disgraceful propositions were readily
assented to; and the three officers went off to the
Sirdar.</p>

<p>Capt. Lawrence received a note from Conolly,
telling him to be cautious, to put ourselves as
little as possible in Akbar's power, and above all
things to push on as fast as we could: but this
note did not arrive until the conference was over,
and all points adjusted.</p>

<p>We commenced our march at about mid-day,
the 5th N. I. in front. The troops were in the
greatest state of disorganisation: the baggage was
mixed in with the advanced guard; and the camp
followers all pushed ahead in their precipitate
flight towards Hindostan.</p>

<p>Sturt, my daughter, Mr. Mein, and I, got up
to the advance; and Mr. Mein was pointing out
to us the spots where the 1st brigade was attacked,
and where he, Sale, &amp;c . were wounded. We had
not proceeded half a mile when we were heavily
fired upon. Chiefs rode with the advance, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
desired us to keep close to them. They certainly
desired their followers to shout to the people on the
height not to fire: they did so, but quite ineffectually.
These chiefs certainly ran the same risk
we did; but I verily believe many of these persons
would individually sacrifice themselves to rid their
country of us.</p>

<p>After passing through some very sharp firing,
we came upon Major Thain's horse, which had
been shot through the loins. When we were supposed
to be in comparative safety, poor Sturt rode
back (to see after Thain I believe): his horse was
shot under him, and before he could rise from the
ground he received a severe wound in the abdomen.
It was with great difficulty he was held
upon a pony by two people, and brought into camp
at Khoord Cabul.</p>

<p>The pony Mrs. Sturt rode was wounded in the
ear and neck. I had fortunately only <i>one</i> ball
<i>in</i> my arm; three others passed through my
poshteen near the shoulder without doing me any
injury. The party that fired on us were not above
fifty yards from us, and we owed our escape to
urging our horses on as fast as they could go over
a road where, at any other time, we should have
walked our horses very carefully.</p>

<p>The main attack of the enemy was on the
column, baggage, and rear guard; and fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
it was for Mrs. Sturt and myself that we kept
with the chiefs. Would to God that Sturt had
done so likewise, and not gone back.</p>

<p>The ladies were mostly travelling in kajavas,
and were mixed up with the baggage and column
in the pass: here they were heavily fired on.
Many camels were killed. On one camel were, in
one kajava, Mrs. Boyd and her youngest boy
Hugh; and in the other Mrs. Mainwaring and her
infant, scarcely three months old, and Mrs. Anderson's
eldest child. This camel was shot. Mrs.
Boyd got a horse to ride; and her child was put
on another behind a man, who being shortly after
unfortunately killed, the child was carried off by
the Affghans. Mrs. Mainwaring, less fortunate,
took her own baby in her arms. Mary Anderson
was carried off in the confusion. Meeting with a
pony laden with treasure, Mrs. M. endeavoured to
mount and sit on the boxes, but they upset; and in
the hurry pony and treasure were left behind; and
the unfortunate lady pursued her way on foot,
until after a time an Affghan asked her if she was
wounded, and told her to mount behind him. This
apparently kind offer she declined, being fearful of
treachery; alleging as an excuse that she could
not sit behind him on account of the difficulty of
holding her child when so mounted. This man
shortly after snatched her shawl off her shoulders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
and left her to her fate. Mrs. M.'s sufferings were
very great; and she deserves much credit for having
preserved her child through these dreadful
scenes. She not only had to walk a considerable
distance with her child in her arms through the
deep snow, but had also to pick her way over the
bodies of the dead, dying, and wounded, both men
and cattle, and constantly to cross the streams of
water, wet up to the knees, pushed and shoved
about by men and animals, the enemy keeping up
a sharp fire, and several persons being killed close
to her. She, however, got safe to camp with her
child, but had no opportunity to change her
clothes; and I know from experience that it was
many days ere my wet habit became thawed, and
can fully appreciate her discomforts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bourke, little Seymour Stoker, and his
mother, and Mrs. Cunningham, all soldiers' wives,
and the child of a man of the 13th, have been
carried off. The rear was protected by the 44th
and 37th; but as they neared the pass, the enemy,
concealed behind rocks, &amp;c . increased their fire
considerably upon them. The companies that had
been skirmishing on the flanks of the rear-guard
closed in; and they slowly entered the pass, keeping
up a heavy fire on the assailants, who had by
this time got amongst the straggling camp followers
and Sipahees. Owing to a halt having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
taken place in front, the pass was completely
choked up; and for a considerable time the 44th
were stationary under a heavy fire, and were fast
expending their ammunition. The 37th continued
slowly moving on without firing a shot; being
paralysed with cold to such a degree that no persuasion
of their officers could induce them to make
any effort to dislodge the enemy, who took from
some of them not only their firelocks, but even
the clothes from their persons; several men of the
44th supplied themselves with ammunition from
the pouches of the Sipahees: and many proceeded
to the front owing to their ammunition being expended.
Major Scott and Capt. Swinton, of the
44th, had also gone to the front severely wounded;
and the command of the regiment devolved on
Capt. Souter. Lieut. Steer, of the 37th N. I.,
with great difficulty succeeded in bringing to the
rear a yaboo loaded with ammunition: but scarcely
were the boxes placed on the ground, opened, and
a few rounds taken out, than they were obliged to
be abandoned; as, owing to our fire having slackened,
the enemy became bolder and pressed upon
the rear in great numbers. They had the advantage
of being covered by our stragglers, which
compelled our men to retire, firing volleys indiscriminately
amongst them and the Affghans. At
this time our men were dropping fast from a flanking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
fire from the heights; and, seeing it was useless
to attempt to maintain a position in the rear,
under such circumstances, with only about sixty
men, they were withdrawn; and with difficulty
forced their way through the crowd to a more
commanding position, where the rear-guard of
the 44th was joined by Gen. Elphinstone, Col.
Chambers, of the 5th Lt. Cavalry, with some
troopers, and Capt. Hay, with a few of the Irregular
Horse, and the only remaining gun, one
having been abandoned in the pass. The 37th
and the camp followers gradually passed to the
front; but the Affghans were checked from following
them.</p>

<p>After halting full an hour to let the stragglers,
&amp;c ., get well to the front, they resumed their
march; but, owing to the depth of the snow, the
troops were compelled to assist the gun by manual
labour, the horses being unable to get it on. In
this way they reached the encamping ground,
without molestation from the enemy.</p>

<p>On leaving Cabul each Sipahee had forty rounds
of musket ammunition in pouch, with 100 spare
loads&mdash;we have now not three camel loads left;
and many Sipahees have not a single cartridge in
pouch.</p>

<p>500 of our regular troops, and about 2500 of
the camp followers, are killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
Poor Sturt was laid on the side of a bank, with
his wife and myself beside him. It began snowing
heavily: Johnson and Bygrave got some xummuls
(coarse blankets) thrown over us. Dr. Bryce,
H. A., came and examined Sturt's wound: he
dressed it; but I saw by the expression of his
countenance that there was no hope. He afterwards
kindly cut the ball out of my wrist, and
dressed both my wounds.</p>

<p>Half of a Sipahee's pall had been pitched, in
which the ladies and their husbands took refuge.
We had no one to scrape the snow off the ground
in it. Capt. Johnson and Mr. Mein first assisted
poor Sturt over to it, and then carried Mrs. Sturt
and myself through the deep snow. Mrs. Sturt's
bedding (saved by the ayah riding on it, whom we
kept up close with ourselves) was now a comfort
for my poor wounded son. He suffered dreadful
agony all night, and intolerable thirst; and most
grateful did we feel to Mr. Mein for going out
constantly to the stream to procure water: we
had only a small vessel to fetch it in, which contained
but a few mouthfuls.</p>

<p>To sleep in such anxiety of mind and intense
cold was impossible. There were nearly thirty of
us packed together without room to turn.</p>

<p>The Sipahees and camp followers, half-frozen,
tried to force their way, not only into the tent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
but actually into our beds, if such resting-places
can be so called&mdash;a poshteen (or pelisse of sheep
skin) half spread on the snow, and the other half
wrapped over one.</p>

<p>Many poor wretches died round the tent in the
night.</p>

<p>The light company of the 54th N. I., which left
Cabul, thirty-six hours previously, eighty strong,
was reduced to eighteen files. This is only one
instance, which may fairly be taken as a general
average of the destruction of our force.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Before sunrise the same confusion as yesterday.
Without any order given, or bugle sounded,
three fourths of our fighting men had pushed on
in advance with the camp followers. As many as
could, had appropriated to themselves all the public
yaboos and camels, on which they mounted.</p>

<p>A portion of the troops had also regularly
moved off, the only order appearing to be, "Come
along; we are all going, and half the men are off,
with the camp followers in advance!" We had
gone perhaps a mile, when the whole were remanded
back to their former ground; and a halt for the
day was ordered, in accordance with the wishes of
the Sirdar; who had represented to the General,
through Capt. Skinner, that his arrangements
were not made either as regarded our security or
provisions. Skinner urged the General to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
some mark of confidence in the Sirdar's promises;
which he instantly did by sending Capt. Anderson
to order back the troops and baggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevor kindly rode a pony, and gave up
her place in the kajava to Sturt, who must otherwise
have been left to die on the ground. The
rough motion increased his suffering and accelerated
his death: but he was still conscious that his
wife and I were with him; and we had the sorrowful
satisfaction of giving him Christian burial.</p>

<p>More than one half of the force is now frostbitten
or wounded; and most of the men can
scarcely put a foot to the ground.</p>

<p>This is the fourth day that our cattle have had
no food; and the men are starved with cold and
hunger.</p>

<p>Reports are prevalent in camp that the Irregular
Cavalry, and the Envoy's escort, are about to desert
to Mahommed Akbar Khan; and also that the
Affghans are tampering with our Sipahees to leave
us and return to Cabul. The Subadar Major of
the 37th N. I. has deserted: he was a Subadar
Bahakur of the Order of British India.</p>

<p>Shortly after Pottinger, Mackenzie, and Lawrence
arrived at the Khoord Cabul fort with the
Sirdar, he turned to Lawrence and said that he
had a proposal to make, but that he did not like
to do so lest his motives might be misconstrued;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
but that, as it concerned us more than himself, he
would mention it; and that it was, that all the
married men, with their families, should come
over and put themselves under his protection, he
guaranteeing them honourable treatment, and safe
escort to Peshawer. He added, that Lawrence
must have seen from the events of the day previous&mdash;the
loss of Capt. Boyd's and Capt. Anderson's
children, &amp;c .&mdash;that our camp was no place
of safety for the ladies and children. Lawrence
replied, that he considered the proposition a most
admirable one; and, Skinner coming in just then,
he repeated what had passed to him, who replied,
"This is just what I was thinking of suggesting."
On which Lawrence begged he would go off and
get the General's sanction, and bring them all without
delay. Major Pottinger concurred entirely in
the expediency of this measure.</p>

<p>Our present position is one of imminent peril.
Immediately on Skinner's arrival about mid-day,
we set off escorted by some chiefs to a fort about
two miles distant, where Mahommed Akbar Khan
had taken up his temporary residence. Capt.
Troup, Brigade-major to the Shah's force, who was
wounded, accompanied the party, as did also Mr.
Mein of the 13th, who, having been sent back
with a year's sick-leave to Cabul, after he was
wounded in October, followed Mrs. Sturt's and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
my fortunes, not being attached to any corps, nor
having any duty to perform.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but that the proposition
was acceded to by the General in the twofold
hope of placing the ladies and children beyond
the dangers and dreadful privations of the camp,
and also of showing the Sirdar that he was sincere
in his wish to negotiate a truce, and thus win
from him a similar feeling of confidence.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with domestic affliction, neither
Mrs. Sturt nor I were in a fit state to decide for
ourselves whether we would accept the Sirdar's
protection or not. There was but faint hope of
our ever getting safe to Jellalabad; and we followed
the stream. But although there was much
talk regarding our going over, all I personally
know of the affair is, that I was told we were
all to go, and that our horses were ready, and we
must mount immediately and be off.</p>

<p>We were taken by a very circuitous route to the
Khoord Cabul forts, where we found Mahommed
Akbar Khan, and the hostages. Mr. Boyd's little
boy had been brought there, and was restored to
his parents. Mrs. Burnes and young Stoker were
also saved, and joined our party. Anderson's
little girl is said to have been taken to Cabul,
to the Nawaub Zeman Shah Khan.</p>

<p>Three rooms were cleared out for us, having no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
outlets except a small door to each; and of course
they were dark and dirty. The party to which
I belonged consisted of Mrs. Trevor and seven
children, Lieut. and Mrs. Waller and child, Mrs.
Sturt, Mr. Mein, and myself, Mrs. Smith and
Mrs. Burnes, two soldiers' wives, and young
Stoker, child of a soldier of the 13th, who was
saved from people who were carrying him off to
the hills, and came in covered, we fear, with
his mother's blood: of her we have no account,
nor of Mrs. Cunningham, both of the 13th. The
dimensions of our room are at the utmost fourteen
feet by ten.</p>

<p>At midnight some mutton bones and greasy
rice were brought to us.</p>

<p>All that Mrs. Sturt and I possess are the
clothes on our backs in which we quitted Cabul.</p>

<p>Here I must divide the account. I shall go on
with my own personal adventures; and afterwards,
from the same date, follow up the fortunes
of our unhappy army, from the journals of friends
who, thank God! have lived through all their
sufferings.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Mahommed Akbar Khan left us, to
escort our troops. 500 deserters are said to have
come in to him. It is reported that the thieves
have nearly exterminated our force; and that four
of Mahommed Akbar's sirdars are killed. Akbar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
is expected back at night; and if the road is clear,
we are to march at night and go thirty miles.
Some officers are said to have taken refuge in a fort
near this place. A letter came from the General,
stating that he wished Capt. Anderson and Capt.
Boyd to return: this was in consequence of a
representation made to him that Anderson's
making over the command of his corps to Lieut.
Le Geyt, and going away, might have a bad effect
on his men, who now showed symptoms of an
inclination to leave us to our fate. But it was
decided by the politicals that for those officers to
return would have the appearance of their faith
in the Sirdar's promises being shaken, and that it
would be productive of much evil: they remained
therefore with us. Here was another instance of
the General's vacillation. Anderson, on his return
from taking the message to bring the troops back,
was ordered by the General to go off with the
other married men and families. Whatever may
have been his own sentiments on the occasion,
his opinion was never asked, and he had but to
obey.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;We marched; being necessitated to leave
all the servants that could not walk, the Sirdar promising
that they should be fed. It would be impossible
for me to describe the feelings with which
we pursued our way through the dreadful scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
that awaited us. The road covered with awfully
mangled bodies, all naked: fifty-eight Europeans
were counted in the Tunghee and dip of the
Nullah; the natives innumerable. Numbers of
camp followers, still alive, frostbitten and starving;
some perfectly out of their senses and idiotic.
Major Ewart, 54th, and Major Scott, 44th, were recognised
as we passed them; with some others. The
sight was dreadful; the smell of the blood sickening;
and the corpses lay so thick it was impossible
to look from them, as it required care to guide my
horse so as not to tread upon the bodies: but it is
unnecessary to dwell on such a distressing and
revolting subject.</p>

<p>We hear that Mahommed Abkar Khan offered
to escort the army down, provided the troops laid
down their arms; but that the General went on,
upon his own responsibility.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Tézeen fort, where we were
well treated; and where we found Lieut. Melville,
54th. He had, in guarding the colour of his regiment,
received five severe wounds. He had fortunately
seven rupees about him; these he gave to
an Affghan to take him to the Sirdar, who dressed
his wounds with his own hands, applying burnt
rags; and paid him every attention.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;We went to Seh Baba; and thence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
out of the road, following the bed of the river, to
Abdoollah Khan's fort. We passed our last gun,
abandoned, with poor Dr. Cardew's body lying on
it, and three Europeans close by it.</p>

<p>During the march, we were joined by Mr.
Magrath, surgeon of the 37th N. I., and six men
of the 44th. He had been wounded and taken
prisoner on the 10th, whilst endeavouring to rally
a party of some forty or fifty irregular cavalry,
and bring them to the assistance of the unfortunate
wounded men, who were being butchered
at the bottom of the Huft Kohtul. On his
coming up with this party, and again ordering
them to halt, to his great disgust he found Khoda
Bukh Khan, a Ghilzye chief, amongst them; to
whom they were apologising for not having gone
over the day previous, as their comrades had
done. Mr. Magrath had several narrow escapes;
and, when surrounded by Ghilzye footmen with
their long knives drawn, owed his life in a great
measure to an Affghan horseman, who recognised
him as having shown some little kindness to some
of his sick friends at Cabul.</p>

<p>At night we had snow.</p>

<p>Our whole party, ladies and gentlemen,
crammed into one room; one side of which was
partitioned off with mats and filled with grain.
Here an old woman cooked chupatties for us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
three for a rupee; but, finding the demand great,
she soon raised the price to a rupee each.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;We travelled over mountain paths,
where the camels found it difficult to get on with
the kajavas, till we arrived at Jugdaluk: near the
Ghavoy there had been fearful slaughter, principally
of Europeans.</p>

<p>We found Gen. Elphinstone, Brig. Shelton, and
Capt. Johnson here in tents.</p>

<p>Having brought our party safe to Jugdaluk, I
now return to the proceedings of our unfortunate
army; taking up the tale at the period when the
ladies and their party took protection. On the 9th
a round Affghan tent was pitched for the ladies;
and we felt the courtesy of the sirdars, who slept
in the open air to give us shelter, even such as it
was, for the wind blew in in every direction.</p>

<p>Immediately after our departure the irregular
horse, with the exception of about eighty men,
went over in a body to the Sirdar; and as they
were afterwards seen in company with a body of
Affghan horse at about a mile distance, there was
an attack from them apprehended: all was consternation.
Several of our Sipahees absented
themselves during the day, also a number of
camp followers. A message was sent to Mahommed
Akbar Khan, and a hope expressed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
he would not favour the desertion of the troops;
and he promised that all going over to him should
be shot, which was immediately made known to
the men. One of the Mission chuprassies was
caught in the act of going off, and shot.</p>

<p>Lieut. Mackay, assistant to Capt. Johnson, was
sent in the afternoon to the Sirdar (to the fort
where the ladies were), for the purpose of being
the bearer of a letter to Gen. Sale at Jellalabad,
to order him to evacuate his position. This letter
was written by Major Pottinger.</p>

<p>All the dhooley bearers either deserted or were
murdered the first day.</p>

<p>The whole of the camels and yaboos have been
either taken by the enemy or plundered by our
no less lawless camp followers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The greatest confusion prevailed all day; and
anxiety and suspense for the ultimate fate of the
army was intense; all expecting that if in a few
hours they were not deprived of life by cold and
hunger, they would fall by the knives of the
Affghans; which, had they been then attacked,
must indubitably have occurred; for on the return
of the troops after their set-out in the morning, commanding
officers had great difficulty in collecting
sixty files a corps: but even of these many could
scarcely hold a musket; many died of cold and
misery that night. To add to their wretchedness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
many were nearly, and some wholly, afflicted with
snow blindness.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;No sooner was it light than the usual
rush to the front was made by the mixed rabble
of camp followers, Sipahees, and Europeans in one
huge mass. Hundreds of poor wretches, unable
to seize any animals for themselves, or despoiled
by stronger persons of those they had, were left
on the road to die or be butchered.</p>

<p>After much exertion, the advance, consisting of
the 44th, the only remaining six-pounder, and
about fifty files of the 5th cavalry, managed to get
ahead of the crowd. The Affghans were appearing
on the hills early: on arriving at the Tunghee
Tareekee, a narrow gorge about ten feet wide
and two miles distant from their last ground,
Capt. Johnson was sent with the advance; the
heights were taken possession of by the enemy;
who fired down incessantly on the road, from
which they were inaccessible. The snow increased
in depth as the army advanced. There is a
gradual ascent all the way from Khoord Cabul
to Kubber-i-Jubhar, a distance of five miles; the
progress was necessarily slow, and many poor
fellows were shot.</p>

<p>After getting through the pass, not above fifty
yards in length, they proceeded to Kubber-i-Jubhar;
where they halted for their comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
Latterly no Affghans had been seen, except at
a distance; the horror of our people was therefore
the greater when a few stragglers from the rear
came up, and reported themselves as the remnant
of the rear column, almost every man of which
had been either killed or wounded: Capt. Hopkins
had his arm broken by a musket ball. There
was now not a single Sipahee left of the whole
Cabul force.</p>

<p>A desperate attack had been made by a body of
Affghans, sword in hand: our men made no resistance,
but threw away their arms and accoutrements;
and fell an easy prey to our barbarous and
bloodthirsty foe.</p>

<p>The rear-guard was composed of the 54th
regiment. On arriving at the narrow pass called
Tunghee Tareekee, or "the dark pass," a turn
in the road shut out from their sight the enemy,
who had followed close on their heels, but on
whom they had received strict orders not to fire;
although the Ghilzyes, from the heights and
ravines, had kept up a sharp discharge, killing
many Sipahees and camp followers, and cutting
up all wounded and sick left behind. On arriving
at the above-mentioned pass, the turn in the road
allowed the Ghilzyes to close up; and a general
attack was made on all sides: hundreds of Affghans
rushing down from the rocks and hills cut to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
pieces their now reduced regiment. Here Major
Ewart, commanding 54th, had both his arms
broken by bullets from the Juzails; Lieut. Morrieson,
the adjutant, was wounded; and Lieut.
Weaver, of the same corps, slightly. Lieut. Melville,
on observing the Jemadar, who carried the
regiment's colour, wounded and dropping his
charge, seized it; and, after vainly attempting to
tear it off the staff, to which it was too firmly
attached, made his way on foot (his horse having
been killed), with the colour in his hand.
This made him a mark for the enemy; and
ere he had got out of the pass, being nearly, or
quite, the last man of the column, or rather rabble,
he received a spear wound in his back, which
threw him on his face: ere well able to rise, a
severe sword-cut in the head again laid him
prostrate; but he contrived to crawl as far as the
fast retreating column; when again the knife of
an Affghan wounding him in the neck, and a spear
in the chin, he gave up all for lost. He was now
surrounded by a dozen Ghilzyes; and no man,
save the dead and dying, near him; when the
enemy, observing a box of treasure on the opposite
side of the pass, left him, for the purpose
of rifling the money, either supposing they had
already killed him, or intending to return when
they had secured the more valuable booty. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
pause gave Lieut. Melville an opportunity of
escaping and regaining the column; which, although
weak from his wounds, he availed himself
of; and by going through the snow in the ravines,
he contrived to reach the column; where a pony
without an owner, or saddle of any description,
presenting itself, he scrambled on to it; and, with
the assistance of a Mehter, gained the centre of
the column, where the 44th and one gun still kept
some order. Lieut. Melville was tied on the gun,
and was told by Gen. Elphinstone, that he should
be sent over to the charge of the Sirdar, Mahommed
Akbar Khan, on reaching Tézeen, or at any
opportunity of going.</p>

<p>On a report of a large body of horse being
observed in the rear, the gun was ordered there;
and Lieut. Melville was placed on a bank on the
road-side. The column passed on; and he was
expecting the fate of the other poor fellows who
had fallen; when, providentially for him, a horseman
rode up, who had known him in cantonments,
and who strapped him on his horse, and took him
over to the party of horsemen, consisting of Mahommed
Akbar Khan and his followers; who
received him most kindly, and, binding up his
wounds, gave him a loonghee, his regimental cap
being cut to pieces.</p>

<p>The loonghee is the cloth worn as a turban
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
commonly by the Affghans, and is generally of
blue check with a red border: those worn by the
Khyberries are much gayer, and have a large
admixture of yellow.</p>

<p>Melville gave to Omer Khan, the horseman
who saved his life, seven rupees, being all the
property he possessed.</p>

<p>Every particle of baggage was gone.</p>

<p>The small remnant of the army consisted of
about seventy files of the 44th, fifty of the 5th
cavalry, and 1 six-pounder gun. Observing a
body of cavalry in their rear, they determined to
bring their solitary gun into position, and make
a last effort for existence. Finding it was again
Mahommed Akbar Khan, Capt. Skinner (Assist.-Com.-Gen.)
by direction of the General, went
over, under escort, to him; to remonstrate on the
attack made on our troops after a treaty had been
entered into for our protection. He replied, he
regretted it, he could not control the Ghilzyes
(the inhabitants of this part of the country) with
his small body of horse, about 300; but that as
the remnant of our troops was merely a few
Europeans, he would guarantee their safety, and
that of all the European officers, to Jellalabad, if
the General would conduct them all disarmed,
whilst the Affghans were to have the use of their
weapons. He said his motives for this were, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
should they bring their arms with them, his own
followers would be afraid of treachery. To this
proposition the General would not assent.</p>

<p>Mackay returned with Skinner from the Sirdar,
as the road to Jellalabad was said to be unsafe.</p>

<p>The troops continued their fearful march: the
remnant of the camp followers, with several
wounded officers, went ahead: for five miles they
saw no enemy: all who could not walk were
necessarily left behind. They descended a long
steep descent to the bed of the Tézeen Nullah.
At this dip the scene was horrible: the ground
was covered with dead and dying, amongst whom
were several officers: they had been suddenly
attacked and overpowered. The enemy here
crowded from the tops of the hills in all directions
down the bed of the Nullah, through
which the route lay for three miles; and our men
continued their progress through an incessant fire
from the heights on both sides, until their arrival
in the Tézeen valley, at about half-past four
<small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>The descent from the Huft Kohtul was about
2000 feet; and here they lost the snow.</p>

<p>About 12,000 persons have perished!</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour after their arrival, the
Sirdar and a party came into the valley to a fort
higher up belonging to his father-in-law, Mahommed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
Shah Khan. A signal was made to his
horsemen to approach: two came, and Capt.
Skinner, by the General's desire, accompanied
them to Mahommed Akbar Khan, to devise some
means of saving the remnant&mdash;about 4,000 people
of all descriptions.</p>

<p>Skinner returned at dusk; and brought back
the same message as from Kubber-i-Jubhar, regarding
disarming the Europeans: and again this
was refused.</p>

<p>The General then decided, weak and famished
as the troops were, and without any prospect of
procuring provisions at Tézeen, to march at seven
in the evening (they had left Khoord Cabul, fifteen
miles from Tézeen, half-past six <small>A.M.</small>), and
proceed, if possible, through the Jugdaluk pass by
eight or nine the next morning. In this consisted
their only chance of safety; for, should the enemy
obtain intimation of their approach, the pass would
be occupied, and the object defeated. Johnson
pointed out to the General that Mahommed Akbar
Khan and his party could, by means of a short cut
across the mountains, start long after them, and
arrive before them, ready to oppose them.</p>

<p>Jugdaluk is about twenty-four miles from
Tézeen; the pass about two miles long, very narrow,
and commanded on both sides by high and
precipitous hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
At Tézeen Gen. Elphinstone received a note
in cypher from Capt. Conolly, warning him
that Mahommed Akbar Khan had quitted Cabul,
with the avowed intention of getting into his
hands the person of the General, and all the married
people with their families.</p>

<p>A message was sent to Mahommed Akbar
Khan that they were going to march to Seh Baba,
seven miles from Tézeen (this place is sometimes
called Tukeea-i-Fakeer): the road lies down the
bed of a Nullah, with high hills on either side.
The place is only remarkable from having a few
trees and a grave or two under them; and from
the latter I believe it takes its name.</p>

<p>The camp followers having been the bane of
this unfortunate army, they hoped to move off
quietly and leave them behind; but no sooner did
they start, than they found that all who were able
to stand were accompanying them. They left
their remaining gun behind; and Dr. Cardew, who
was mortally wounded at the dip into the Tézeen
Nullah, was laid on the carriage to await death,
which was rapidly approaching: he was found
dead by Mahommed Akbar's people the next
morning.</p>

<p>The night was fine and moonlit, and they
reached Seh Baba about midnight; here a few
shots were fired on them; and the rear being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
attacked, the whole remains of the 44th, with the
exception of about nine files to form the advance,
were ordered there; and thus the column remained
until their arrival at Jugdaluk; their progress
being again impeded by that evil which always
attends Indian armies, the camp followers; who,
if a shot is fired in advance, invariably fall back;
and if in rear, rush to the front.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;From Seh Baba the road turns off sharp
to the right over the mountains to Jugdaluk;
and across the Nullah is seen the short road to
Cabul, but which cannot be travelled by guns or
camels.</p>

<p>At Seh Baba Dr. Duff (the Surgeon-General
to the forces in Affghanistan), who had had
his hand cut off with a penknife at Tézeen,
in consequence of a severe wound, was from
weakness obliged to lag behind, and was two days
afterwards found murdered.</p>

<p>Bareekub is three miles from Seh Baba: there
is a clear stream of water, and several caves cut
in the rocks. Here our force observed a number
of people in the caves; with whom they did not
interfere, as they did not molest them. They
eventually fired some volleys on the rear.</p>

<p>At daybreak the advance arrived at Killa
Sung, about seven miles from Seh Baba, where
there are some streams of water: this is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
general encamping ground, though very confined,
and commanded by hills all round.</p>

<p>They proceeded about half a mile further on, and
then halted, until the rear-guard should arrive;
but they, having been much molested on the
road, did not arrive for two hours. On their first
arrival not an Affghan was to be seen; but shortly
several made their appearance on the hills, and the
number continued every moment to increase. Not
a drop of water was procurable; nor would they
get any until their arrival at Jugdaluk. They had
marched for twenty-four hours consecutively, and
had still ten miles to go before they could hope
for rest. On being joined by the rear-guard they
continued their march; the enemy in small numbers
watching every opportunity to murder stragglers
from the column.</p>

<p>At two miles from Jugdaluk the descent into
the valley commences.</p>

<p>The hills on each side of the road were occupied
by the enemy, who kept firing from their
long juzails; and again the road was covered with
dead and dying, as they were in such a mass that
every shot told.</p>

<p>On arrival in the valley, a position was taken
up on the first height near some ruined walls. As
scarcely any Europeans of the advance now remained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
and the enemy were increasing, the General
called all the officers (about twenty) to form
line and show a front: they had scarcely done so
when Capt. Grant, Assistant-Adjutant-General,
received a ball through the cheek which broke his
jaw.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the rear-guard, followed up
by the enemy, the latter took possession of two
heights close to our position: on which our force
went for security within the ruined walls. The
men were almost maddened with hunger and
thirst: a stream of pure water ran within 150
yards of the position, but no man could go for it
without being massacred.</p>

<p>For about half an hour they had a respite from
the fire of the enemy, who now only watched
their proceedings.</p>

<p>The General desired Johnson to see if there
were any bullocks or camels procurable amongst
the followers: he obtained three bullocks, which
were killed, served out, and devoured instantly,
although raw, by the Europeans.</p>

<p>A few horsemen coming in sight, they signed
for one to approach: he did so, and on being questioned
what chief was present, said Mahommed
Akbar Khan. A message was sent to the Sirdar
by the General to know why they were again
molested: the chief replied, he wished to converse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
with Skinner, who immediately accompanied the
messenger. This was about half past three <small>P.M.</small>
of the 11th.</p>

<p>After marching for thirty hours they lay down
on the ground worn out by cold, hunger, thirst,
and fatigue: but scarcely had Skinner taken his
departure, when volley after volley was poured
into the enclosure where they were resting. All
was instant confusion, and a general rush took
place outside the walls; men and cattle all huddled
together, each striving to hide himself from the
murderous fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>At this time twenty gallant men of the 44th
made a simultaneous rush down the hill, to drive
the enemy off the heights they occupied: in this
they were successful; for, supposing they were
followed by the rest, the foe took to flight ere our
men could reach their position.</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour, as so small a
party would not admit of any division, this party
was recalled. They again entered within the
broken walls; and instantly our inveterate foes
were in their former position dealing death amongst
them.</p>

<p>About 5 o'clock Skinner returned with a
message that the Sirdar wished to see the General,
Brig. Shelton, and Johnson; and if they would go
over to confer with him, he would engage to put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
a stop to any further massacre, and also to give
food to our troops: and on condition of their
remaining with him as hostages for Gen. Sale's
evacuation of Jellalabad, he would escort all the
small remaining party in safety.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan, father-in-law to the
Sirdar, and whose daughter is with the Dost at
Loodianah, is one of the principal Ghilzye chiefs:
he came at dusk with an escort to receive them;
and they started in the confident hope that some
arrangement would be entered into to save the
lives of the remainder of the army. The General
and the above-mentioned officers proceeded to
the top of the valley for about two miles, and
found the Sirdar and his party in bivouac:
nothing could exceed the kind manner in which
they were received. The chief, on hearing they
had not tasted food for forty-eight hours, had a
cloth spread on the ground; and a good pillau and
other dishes, as also tea, were quickly brought;
and they formed a circle round it, and all ate out
of the same dish.</p>

<p>Their hunger, though great, was not to be compared
to their thirst, which had not been quenched
for two days.</p>

<p>The party consisted of the Sirdar, Mahommed
Akbar Khan, Mahommed Shah Khan, Abdool
Ghyas Khan (son of Jubhar Khan), and a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
lad called Abdool Hakeem Khan, nephew to the
Sirdar. The attention of the Sirdar and his
party was excessive; and after dinner they sat
round a blazing fire, and conversed on various
subjects. The General requested that Mahommed
Akbar Khan would early in the morning forward
provisions to the troops, and make arrangements
for supplying them with water: all which he faithfully
promised to do.</p>

<p>The General was anxious for permission to
return to his troops; and offered to send Brig.
Anquetil, should the Sirdar require an officer in
his stead. Johnson, by the General's desire,
pointed out to the Sirdar the stigma that would
attach to him as commander of the force, were he
to remain in a place of comparative security,
whilst such danger impended over the troops.
To this the Sirdar would not consent. At about
11 <small>P.M.</small>, the Sirdar promised he would early in
the morning call the chiefs of the pass together, to
make arrangements for a safe escort: he then
showed them into a small tent, where, stretched
on their cloaks, they found relief in sleep.</p>

<p>Our unfortunate force at Jugdaluk this day
consisted of 150 men of the 44th; 16 dismounted
horse artillery men; 25 of the 5th
cavalry. Not a single Sipahee with arms, no
spare ammunition, and the few rounds in pouch
had been taken from the killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
<i>12th.</i>&mdash;The English officers arose at sunrise,
and found the Sirdar and his party were up. They
showed them the same civility as over night; two
confidential servants of the chief were appointed
to wait on them; and they were warned not to
attempt to leave the tent without one of these
men, lest they should be maltreated or insulted
by the Ghilzyes, who were flocking in to pay
their respects to Mahommed Akbar.</p>

<p>About 9 <small>A.M.</small>, the chiefs of the pass and the
country around Soorkhab arrived. Soorkhab is
about thirteen miles from Jugdaluk, towards
Jellalabad, and is the usual halting ground.</p>

<p>The chiefs sat down to discuss affairs. They
were bitter in their hatred towards us; and declared
that nothing would satisfy them and their
men, but our extermination. Money they would
not receive. The Sirdar, as far as words could
prove his sincerity, did all in his power to conciliate
them; and, when all other arguments
failed, reminded them that his father and family
were in the power of the British government at
Loodianah; and that vengeance would be taken
on the latter if mercy were not showed to the
British in their power.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan offered them 60,000
rupees on condition of our force not being molested.
After some time they took their departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
to consult with their followers; and Mahommed
Shah Khan mentioned to Johnson that he feared
the chiefs would not, without some great inducement,
resist the temptation of plunder and murder
that now offered itself: and wound up the discourse
by asking if we would give them two
lakhs of rupees for a free passage. On this being
explained to the General, he gave his consent; and
it was made known to Mahommed Shah Khan,
who went away and promised to return quickly.</p>

<p>The General again begged of the Sirdar to
permit him to return to his troops; but without
avail.</p>

<p>Johnson, by the General's desire, wrote early
in the day to Skinner, to come to the Sirdar.
This letter and two others, it is to be feared, he
never received. A report was brought in that
Skinner was wounded, but not dangerously; the
Sirdar expressed much sorrow; poor Skinner died
of his wound the same day.</p>

<p>Until 12 o'clock crowds of Ghilzyes with their
respective chiefs, continued to pour in from the
surrounding country to make their salaams to
Mahommed Akbar Khan, to participate in the
plunder of our unfortunate people, and to revel
in the massacre of the Europeans. From their
expressions of hatred towards our whole race,
they appeared to anticipate more delight in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
cutting our throats than in the expected booty.
However, on a hint from the Sirdar, they changed
the language, in which they conversed, from
Persian to Pushtoo, which was not understood
by our officers.</p>

<p>The Sirdar, to all appearance, whilst sitting
with Johnson, endeavoured to conciliate them;
but it very probably was only done as a blind to
hide his real feelings.</p>

<p>In two instances, the reply of the chiefs was,&mdash;"When
Burnes came into this country, was not
your father entreated by us to kill him; or he
would go back to Hindostan, and at some future
day bring an army and take our country from
us? He would not listen to our advice, and
what is the consequence? Let us now, that we
have the opportunity, take advantage of it; and
kill those infidel dogs."</p>

<p>At about 12, the Sirdar left them, and went
on the top of a hill in rear of the British
bivouac. He did not return till sunset; and in
reply to the anxious inquiry when Mahommed
Shah Khan would return, they were always told
immediately. Frequent assurances had been given
that the troops had been supplied with food and
water; but subsequently they learnt that neither
had been given them in their dire necessity.</p>

<p>The Sirdar returned at dusk; and was soon followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
by Mahommed Shah Khan, who brought
intelligence that all was finally and amicably arranged
for the safe conduct of the troops to Jellalabad.
The Sirdar said he would accompany them
in the morning early. By the General's request,
Johnson wrote to Brig. Anquetil to have the
troops in readiness to march by 8 o'clock: he had
also commenced a letter to Gen. Sale to evacuate
Jellalabad (this being part of the terms). Suddenly,
and before the first note was sent off, much
musketry was heard down the valley in the direction
of the troops; and a report was brought in
that the Europeans were moving off through the
pass followed by the Ghilzyes. All was consternation.
At first the Sirdar suggested that he
and the officers should follow them: in this the
General concurred. In a few minutes the Sirdar
changed his mind; said he feared their doing so
would injure the troops, by bringing after them
the whole horde of Ghilzyes then assembled in
the valley. He promised to send a confidential
servant to Meer Afzul Khan at Gundamuk (two
miles beyond Soorkhab) to afford them protection;
and agreed to start with them at midnight,
as being mounted they would overtake the others
before daybreak. When about to separate for the
night, the Sirdar again altered the time of departure
to the first hour of daylight. Remonstrances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
were of no avail; and our party were too completely
in the power of the enemy, to persist in
what they had not the power to enforce.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan told Johnson, after
Mahommed Shah Khan went out to consult with
the chiefs of the pass, that the latter were dogs
and no faith could be placed in them; and begged
Johnson would send for three or four of his most
intimate friends, that their lives might be saved in
the event of treachery to the troops. Gladly as
he would have saved his individual friends, he
was under the necessity of explaining to the Sirdar
that a sense of honour would prevent the officers
deserting their men at a time of such imminent
peril. The Sirdar also proposed, that in the event
of the Ghilzyes not acceding to the terms, he
would himself, at dusk, proceed with a party of
horsemen to the foot of the hill where our troops
were; and, previous orders being sent to the commanding
officer for all to be ready, he would bring
every European away in safety, by each of his
horsemen taking up one behind him: the Ghilzyes
would not then fire upon them, lest they should hit
him or his men. But he would not allow a single
Hindostanee to follow; as he could not protect
2000 men (the computed number).&mdash;Johnson interpreted
all this to the General: but it was
deemed impracticable; as from past experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
they knew how impossible it was even to separate
the Sipahees from the camp followers. Four or
five times during the day they heard the report of
musketry in the direction of our troops; but they
were always told that all fighting had ceased. This
was subsequently proved to be a gross falsehood.
Our troops were incessantly fired upon from the
time that the General and the other officers
quitted them to the time of their departure, and
several hundreds of officers and men had been
killed or wounded. The remainder, maddened
with cold, hunger, and thirst, the communication
between them and the General cut off, and seeing
no prospect but certain death before them by remaining
in their present position, determined on
making one desperate effort to leave Jugdaluk.
Snow fell during the night.</p>

<p>My narrative now continues from information
furnished by a friend remaining with the remnant
of this ill-fated army.&mdash;They halted this day at
Jugdaluk, hoping to negotiate an arrangement
with Mahommed Akbar Khan and the Ghilzye
chiefs, as before stated: but the continual firing,
and frequent attempts made by the enemy to force
them from their position during the day, but too
well indicated that there was little or no chance
of negotiations being effectual to quell hostilities,
and admit of their resuming their march in safety:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
on the contrary, there appeared an evident determination
still to harass their retreat to the very
last.</p>

<p>Near the close of the day the enemy commenced
a furious attack from all sides. The situation of our
troops at this time was critical in the extreme: the
loss they sustained in men and officers had been
great during the day, and the survivors had only
been able to obtain a scanty meal of camel's flesh:
even water was not procurable without the parties
proceeding for it being exposed to a heavy fire. The
men, under all this suffering, perishing with cold
at their post, bravely repelled the enemy; and
would then have followed them from under the
dilapidated walls had they been permitted to do
so. During this conflict Capt. Souter of the 44th,
anxious to save the colours of his regiment, tore
one of them from its staff, and folding it round his
person, concealed it under the poshteen he wore:
the other was in like manner appropriated by Lieut.
Cumberland; but finding that he could not close
his pea-coat over it, he reluctantly entrusted it to
the care of the Acting Quartermaster-Sergeant of
the 44th regiment.</p>

<p>Great anxiety prevailed amongst the troops,
caused by the continued absence of Gen. Elphinstone
and Brigadier Shelton, the two seniors in
command. It was resolved, as they did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
return, to resume their march as soon as the
night should shroud them from observation; and
Brig. Anquetil, now in command, ordered the
troops to fall in at eight o'clock: but before the
men could take the places assigned to them, the
camp followers, who were still numerous, crowded
upon them as usual. At length between 8 and
9 o'clock they took their departure; which was
rendered a very trying scene, from the entreaties
of the wounded, amounting to seventy or eighty,
for whom there was no conveyance; and therefore,
however heartrending to all, they were necessarily
abandoned, with the painful conviction that they
would be massacred in cold blood, defenceless
as they were, by the first party of Ghilzyes that
arrived.</p>

<p>The enemy, who seem to have been aware of
the intended removal, soon commenced an attack
upon the straggling camp followers: and a number
of Affghans, favoured by the darkness of the night,
stole in amongst the followers that were in column,
whom they quietly despatched, and proceeded to
plunder. These daring men, however, were nearly
all cut up or bayonetted by the enraged soldiery;
who shortly after came upon an encampment of
the enemy; in passing which they were saluted
with a heavy fire, followed up by a sally upon
the camp followers, as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
They proceeded on until they came to a gorge,
with low steep hills on either side, between which
the road passed, about two miles from Jugdaluk.
Here two barriers had been thrown across the
road, constructed of bushes and branches of trees.
The road, which had been flooded, was a mass of
ice, and the snow on the hills very deep. The
enemy, who had waited for them in great force at
this spot, rushed upon the column, knife in hand.
The camp followers and wounded men fell back
upon the handful of troops for protection; thus
rendering them powerless, and causing the greatest
confusion; whilst the men, in small detached
parties, were maintaining conflicts with fearful
odds against them.</p>

<p>In this conflict the Acting Quartermaster-Sergeant
fell: and in the confusion, caused by an
overwhelming enemy pressing on the rear in a
night attack, it is not surprising that it was found
impossible to extricate the colour from the body
of the fallen man; and its loss was unavoidable.
The disorder of the troops was increased by a
part of them, the few remaining horsemen, galloping
through and over the infantry in hopes of
securing their own retreat to Jellalabad. The men,
maddened at being ridden over, fired on them;
and it is said that some officers were fired at; but
that rests on doubtful testimony. When the firing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
slackened, and the clashing of knives and bayonets
had in some measure ceased, the men moved on
slowly; and on arriving at the top of the gorge
were able to ascertain the fearful extent of the
loss they had sustained in men and officers. Of
the latter Brigadier Anquetil and above twenty
others were missing. The troops now halted
unmolested for an hour; during which time a
few stragglers contrived to join them.</p>

<p>The country being now of a more open description,
our small force suffered less annoyance
from the fire of the enemy: but the determination
of the men to bring on their wounded comrades
greatly retarded their marching; and from the
troopers having proceeded onwards the wounded
could not be mounted behind them: thus their
pace did not exceed two miles in the hour.
From time to time sudden attacks were made on
the rear; particularly in spots where the road
wound close under the foot of the hills, and there
a sharp fire was sure to be met with. In this manner
they went on till they reached the Soorkhab
river, which they forded below the bridge at 1 <small>A.M.</small>
on the 13th, being aware that the enemy would
take possession of it, and dispute the passage.
Whilst fording the river a galling fire was kept
up from the bridge: here Lieut. Cadett of the
44th and several men were killed and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
<i>13th.</i>&mdash;From Soorkhab the remnant of the
column moved towards Gundamuk: but as the day
dawned the enemy's numbers increased; and unfortunately
daylight soon exposed to them how very
few fighting men the column contained. The force
now consisted of twenty officers, of whom Major
Griffiths was the senior, fifty men of the 44th, six
of the horse artillery, and four or five Sipahees.
Amongst the whole there were but twenty muskets;
300 camp followers still continued with them.</p>

<p>Being now assailed by an increased force, they
were compelled to quit the road, and take up a
position on a hill adjoining. Some Affghan horsemen
being observed at a short distance were
beckoned to. On their approach there was a cessation
of firing: terms were proposed by Capt. Hay,
to allow the force to proceed without further hostilities
to Jellalabad. These persons not being sufficiently
influential to negotiate, Major Griffiths
proceeded with them to a neighbouring chief for
that purpose; taking with him Mr. Blewitt, formerly
a writer in Capt. Johnson's office, who understood
Persian, that he might act as interpreter.</p>

<p>Many Affghans ascended the hill where our
troops awaited the issue of the expected conference;
and exchanges of friendly words passed
between both parties. This lasted upwards of an
hour; but hostilities were renewed by the Affghans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
who snatched at the fire-arms of the men and
officers. This they of course resisted; and drove
them off the hill: but the majority of the enemy,
who occupied the adjoining hills commanding our
position, commenced a galling fire upon us. Several
times they attempted to dislodge our men from the
hill, and were repulsed: until, our ammunition being
expended, and our fighting men reduced to about
thirty, the enemy made a rush, which in our weak
state we were unable to cope with. They bore
our men down knife in hand; and slaughtered all
the party except Capt. Souter and seven or eight
men of the 44th and artillery. This officer thinks
that this unusual act of forbearance towards him
originated in the strange dress he wore: his poshteen
having opened during the last struggle exposed
to view the colour he had wrapped round
his body; and they probably thought they had
secured a valuable prize in some great bahadur,
for whom a large ransom might be obtained.</p>

<p>Eighteen officers and about fifty men were killed
at the final struggle at Gundamuk. Capt. Souter
and the few remaining men (seven or eight) that
were taken alive from the field were, after a detention
of a month in the adjoining villages, made
over to Mahommed Akbar Khan and sent to the
fort of Buddeeabad in the Lughman valley, where
they arrived on the 15th of February.</p>

<h3>THE CAPTIVITY.</h3>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now return to the General and his
party. At daybreak on the 13th the Sirdar had
again changed his mind; and instead of following
up the troops, he decided to move to the position
they had vacated, and remain there during the
day; and should the ladies and officers left at
Khoord Cabul arrive in the evening, that all
should start the next morning over the mountains
to the valley of Lughman, north of Jellalabad.
At 8 <small>A.M.</small>, they mounted their horses; and with
the Sirdar and his party rode down the pass,
which bore fearful evidence to the last night's
struggle. They passed some 200 dead bodies,
many of them Europeans; the whole naked, and
covered with large gaping wounds. As the day
advanced, several poor wretches of Hindostanees
(camp followers, who had escaped the massacre of
the night before) made their appearance from
behind rocks and within caves, where they had
taken shelter from the murderous knives of the
Affghans and the inclemency of the climate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
They had been stripped of all they possessed;
and few could crawl more than a few yards, being
frostbitten in the feet. Here Johnson found
two of his servants: the one had his hands and
feet frostbitten, and had a fearful sword cut
across one hand, and a musket ball in his stomach;
the other had his right arm completely cut
through the bone. Both were utterly destitute
of covering, and had not tasted food for five days.</p>

<p>This suffices for a sample of the sufferings of
the survivors.</p>

<p>About four o'clock Sultan Jan (a cousin of the
Sirdar) arrived with the ladies and gentlemen; also
Lieut. Melville of the 54th, and Mr. Magrath,
surgeon of the 37th, both of whom had been
wounded between Khoord Cabul and Tézeen.
A large party of cavalry accompanied Sultan
Jan, both Affghan and our irregular horse, who
had deserted, as before mentioned.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;We marched twenty-four miles to Kutz-i-Mahommed
Ali Khan: started at about 9 <small>A.M.</small>;
the Sirdar with Gen. Elphinstone; Brig. Shelton,
and Capt. Johnson bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>We travelled over a dreadfully rough road:
some of the ascents and descents were fearful to
look at, and at first sight appeared to be impracticable.
The whole road was a continuation of
rocks and stones, over which the camels had great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
difficulty in making their way; and particularly
in the ascent of the Adrak-Budrak pass, where I
found it requisite to hold tight on by the mane,
lest the saddle and I should slip off together.</p>

<p>Had we travelled under happier auspices, I
should probably have been foolish enough to have
expressed fear, not having even a saces to assist me.
Still I could not but admire the romantic tortuous
defile we passed through, being the bed of a
mountain torrent, which we exchanged for the
terrific pass I have mentioned, and which was
rendered doubly fearful by constant stoppages
from those in front, which appeared to take
place at the most difficult spots.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the defile, and for
some considerable distance, we passed 200 or 300
of our miserable Hindostanees, who had escaped
up the unfrequented road from the massacre of
the 12th. They were all naked, and more or less
frostbitten: wounded, and starving, they had set fire
to the bushes and grass, and huddled all together
to impart warmth to each other. Subsequently
we heard that scarcely any of these poor wretches
escaped from the defile: and that driven to the
extreme of hunger they had sustained life by
feeding on their dead comrades.</p>

<p>The wind blew bitterly cold at our bivouac; for
the inhabitants of the fort refused to take us in;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
stating that we were Kaffirs. We therefore rolled
ourselves up as warm as we could; and with our
saddles for pillows braved the elements. Gen.
Elphinstone, Brig. Shelton, and Johnson considered
themselves happy when one of the Affghans
told them to accompany him into a wretched cowshed,
which was filled with dense smoke from
a blazing fire in the centre of the hut. These
officers and Mr. Melville were shortly after invited
by Mahommed Akbar Khan to dine with him
and his party in the fort. The reception room
was not much better than that they had left:
they had, however, a capital dinner, some cups of
tea, and luxurious rest at night; the room having
been well heated by a blazing fire with plenty of
smoke, with no outlet for either heat or smoke,
except through the door and a small circular hole
in the roof.</p>

<p><i>15th January.</i>&mdash;A bitterly cold wind blowing,
we started at 7 <small>A.M.</small>; crossed two branches of
the Punjshir river, which was not only deep, but
exceedingly rapid. The chiefs gave us every
assistance: Mahommed Akbar Khan carried Mrs.
Waller over behind him on his own horse. One
rode by me to keep my horse's head well up the
stream. The Affghans made great exertions to
save both men and animals struggling in the
water; but in spite of all their endeavours five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
unfortunates lost their lives. We passed over
many ascents and declivities; and at about 3 <small>P.M.</small>
arrived at Tighree, a fortified town in the rich
valley of Lughman; having travelled twenty miles
over a most barren country, without a blade
of grass or drop of water until we approached
Tighree. Our route lay along a tract of country
considerably higher than Lughman, with scarcely
a footpath visible the whole way. The road was
good for any kind of carriage. We passed over
the Plain of Methusaleh; and saw at a short distance
the Kubber-i-Lamech, a celebrated place
of pilgrimage, about two miles from Tighree
and twenty-five from Jellalabad.</p>

<p>The Sirdar desired the General, the Brigadier,
and Johnson to take up their quarters with him,
whilst the ladies and the other gentlemen were
located in another fort.</p>

<p>A great number of Hindu Bunneahs reside
at Tighree. We went to the fort of Gholab
Moyenoodeen, who took Mrs. Sturt and myself to
the apartments of his mother and wife. Of course
we could not understand much that they said; but
they evidently made much of us, pitied our condition,
told us to ask them for any thing we
required, and before parting they gave us a lump
of goor filled with pistaches, a sweetmeat they are
themselves fond of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
<i>16th.</i>&mdash;Halted. They tell us we are here only
thirty miles from Jellalabad. It being Sunday, we
read prayers from a Bible and Prayer Book that
were picked up on the field at Bhoodkhak. The
service was scarcely finished when a clannish row
commenced. Some tribes from a neighbouring
fort who had a blood feud with the chiefs with us
came against the fort: a few juzails were fired;
there was great talking and noise; and then it
was all over.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Early in the morning we were ordered
to prepare to go higher up the valley. Thus all
hopes (faint as they were) of going to Jellalabad
were annihilated; and we plainly saw that, whatever
might be said, we were virtually prisoners,
until such time as Sale shall evacuate Jellalabad,
or the Dost be permitted by our government to
return to this country.</p>

<p>We had a little hail this morning; and shortly
after, at about nine o'clock, we started, and
travelled along the valley, which was a continuation
of forts, until we arrived at Buddeeabad
(about eight or nine miles): it is situated
almost at the top of the valley, and close to the
first range of hills towards Kaffiristan.</p>

<p>Six rooms, forming two sides of an inner square
or citadel, are appropriated to us; and a tykhana
to the soldiers. This fort is the largest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
valley, and is quite new; it belongs to Mahommed
Shah Khan: it has a deep ditch and a fausse-braye
all round. The walls of mud are not very
thick, and are built up with planks in tiers on the
inside. The buildings we occupy are those intended
for the chief and his favourite wife; those for
three other wives are in the outer court, and have
not yet been roofed in. We number 9 ladies, 20
gentlemen, and 14 children. In the tykhana are
17 European soldiers, 2 European women, and 1
child (Mrs. Wade, Mrs. Burnes, and little
Stoker).</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan, to our horror, has
informed us that only one man of our force has
succeeded in reaching Jellalabad (Dr. Brydon of
the Shah's force: he was wounded in two places).
Thus is verified what we were told before leaving
Cabul; "that Mahommed Akbar would annihilate
the whole army, except one man, who should
reach Jellalabad to tell the tale."</p>

<p>Dost Mahommed Khan (the brother of Mahommed
Shah Khan) is to have charge of us.
Our parties were divided into the different rooms.
Lady Macnaghten, Capt. and Mrs. Anderson
and 2 children, Capt. and Mrs. Boyd and 2
children, Mrs. Mainwaring and 1 child, with
Lieut. and Mrs. Eyre and 1 child, and a
European girl, Hester Macdonald, were in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
room; that adjoining was appropriated for their
servants and baggage. Capt. Mackenzie and
his Madras Christian servant Jacob, Mr. and
Mrs. Ryley and 2 children, and Mr. Fallon,
a writer in Capt. Johnson's office, occupied
another. Mrs. Trevor and her 7 children
and European servant, Mrs. Smith, Lieut. and
Mrs. Waller and child, Mrs. Sturt, Mr. Mein,
and I had another. In two others all the rest
of the gentlemen were crammed.</p>

<p>It did not take us much time to arrange our
property; consisting of one mattress and resai
between us, and no clothes except those we had
on, and in which we left Cabul.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan, Sultan Jan, and
Ghoolam Moyenoodeen visited us. The Sirdar
assured me we were none of us prisoners; requested
that we would make ourselves as comfortable
as circumstances would admit of; and told
us that as soon as the roads were safe we should
be safely escorted to Jellalabad. He further informed
me that I might write to Sale; and that
any letters I sent to him he would forward. Of
this permission I gladly took advantage to write a
few guarded lines to say that we were well and safe.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;We luxuriated in dressing, although we
had no clothes but those on our backs; but we
enjoyed washing our faces very much, having had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
but one opportunity of doing so before, since we
left Cabul. It was rather a painful process, as
the cold and glare of the sun on the snow had
three times peeled my face, from which the skin
came off in strips.</p>

<p>We had a grand breakfast, dhall and radishes;
the latter large hot ones that had gone to seed, the
former is a common pulse eaten by the natives:
but any change was good, as we find our chupatties
made of the coarse ottah any thing but nice.
Ottah is what in England is called pollard; and
has to be twice sifted ere it becomes flour. The
chupatties are cakes formed of this ottah mixed
with water, and dried by standing by the fire set
up on edge. Eating these cakes of dough is a
capital recipe to obtain the heartburn. We parch
rice and barley, and make from them a substitute
for coffee. Two sheep (alias lambs) are killed daily;
and a regular portion of rice and ottah given for
all. The Affghans cook; and well may we exclaim
with Goldsmith, "God sends meat, but the devil
sends cooks;" for we only get some greasy skin
and bones served out as they are cooked, boiled in
the same pot with the rice, all in a lump. Capt.
Lawrence divides it; and portions our food as
justly as he can. The chupatty is at once the
plate and bread: few possess other dinner-table
implements than their fingers. The rice even is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
rendered nauseous by having quantities of rancid
ghee poured over it, such as in India we should
have disdained to use for our lamps.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The weather cleared up at noon. Major
Pottinger is said to have received information
that Zeman Shah Khan and all the Dooranees
have surrendered to Shah Shoojah; and that his
Majesty was at the bottom of the whole affair to
turn us out of Affghanistan.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;I heard from Sale, dated the 19th. Our
force can hold out at Jellalabad for six months.
It is calculated that Col. Wylde must be at Jellalabad
to-day with 5000 men. Gen. Pollock is
coming with an army across the Punjab.</p>

<p>We hear that Mahommed Akbar has been
offered the Sirdar-i-sirdaranee; but has refused it.
He is said to be gone, or going, to the Khyber.</p>

<p><i>23rd, Sunday.</i>&mdash;After prayers Mahommed
Akbar Khan and Sultan Jan paid us a visit: the
latter took charge of a letter from me for Sale. He
told me that Abdool Guffoor Khan says that Sale
is quite well.</p>

<p>They say that Shah Shoojah demanded Conolly
and three other hostages to be given up
to him to put them to death; but Zeman Shah
Khan refused.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;A day or two ago the Sirdar sent some
chintz to be divided amongst us. A second quantity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
was to-day given out; and we are working
hard that we may enjoy the luxury of getting on
a clean suit of clothes. There are very few of
us that are not covered with crawlers; and, although
my daughter and I have as yet escaped,
we are in fear and trembling.</p>

<p>It is now said that the General gave Anderson's
horse permission to go over to the enemy: a circumstance
that does not at all agree with his conduct
on the day following our taking protection;
when he wished for Anderson's return lest the
men should desert.</p>

<p>Dost Mahommed Khan took Mrs. Trevor's boys
and some of the gentlemen out walking in the
sugar-cane fields near the fort, which they enjoyed
very much.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar sent eight pieces of long cloth
to be divided amongst us. I fancy he is generous
at little cost; and that it is all a part of the
plunder of our camp. He is said to have received
letters from the Khyber stating that our force
has been defeated there; two guns taken, and
some treasure: and that Mackeson is shut up in
Ali Musjid with 300 men.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;As soon as the Bukhraeed is over, Shah
Shoojah is to send 4000 men, and all the guns we
left in Cabul, against Jellalabad. A Mussulman
force is also now at Balabagh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
Mahommed Akbar Khan has had a private
conference with Major Pottinger; of which no
account has transpired. We had two shocks of
earthquake at night.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;A report that Sale has made another
sally, and has taken a number of prisoners. I
heard from him to-day: he has sent me my chest
of drawers, with clothes, &amp;c .: they were all permitted
to come to me unexamined. I had also an
opportunity of writing to him by Abdool Guffoor
Khan, who brought them to me. I was rejoiced
to see any one I had known before; and especially
one who was well inclined towards the English,
though nominally on the side of Akbar.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;The irregular cavalry have had their
horses and everything taken away from them;
and have been turned adrift. I wrote to Sale,
but my note did not go.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;My note to Sale was sent to-day. I got
another from him dated the 29th, and replied
to it.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;We hear that all our horses are to be taken
away; as also our servants. Rain to-day, as if the
clouds wept for our misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;I received boxes from Sale, with many
useful things; and also books, which are a great
treat to us. I wrote to him, but fear my letter
will not reach him, as all notes that came for us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
were kept back by the Sirdar; who is very angry,
having detected a private cossid between Capt.
Macgregor and Major Pottinger: if we behave ill
again, the Sirdar says, woe will betide us. Abdool
Guffoor again came to see us; and I had again the
comfort to hear that Sale was well. We had
rain to-day. Major Griffith arrived, with Mr.
Blewitt.</p>

<p>Major Griffith tells me, that on the morning of
the 13th, at daylight, the miserable remains of
the force, reduced to about 100 Europeans of
all ranks, including 20 officers, worn out with
fatigue and hunger, and encumbered with very
many wounded, some on horseback and some on
foot, were, when within four miles of the bridge of
Gundamuk, surrounded by a considerable number
of the enemy both horse and foot. They had only
thirty-five muskets and but little ammunition remaining;
finding it impossible to proceed further, a
position was taken up on a hill to the left of the
road; and a parley opened with the enemy by means
of waving a white cloth. This produced a cessation
of the firing; and brought four or five men up to ascertain
the cause. It was unanimously agreed that
he (Major Griffith), as senior officer of the party,
should go to the chief, and endeavour to make some
terms for the peaceful march of the party to Jellalabad.
He accordingly went, accompanied by Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Blewitt as interpreter, escorted by one or two of the
enemy. On reaching the chief, they were hurried
off without his giving them the opportunity of
making any proposal. The last sight Major Griffith
had of the party he had left, they appeared to be
engaged in hostilities with the Affghans, whose
numbers had gradually increased. He afterwards
understood that the waving of a loonghee is considered
by them as an act of unconditional surrender;
and as our party would not give up their
arms, the Affghans resorted to force; but were
driven off the hill for the time. The few natives
who had accompanied us so far did not go up the
hill; but kept the road, and were seen to be plundered
by the enemy. This he was afterwards told
by Capt. Souter; who was brought to the village of
Tootoo some hours after Major Griffith was taken
there. This village was between two and three
miles to the right of the scene of action. The
same evening Major Griffith and Mr. Blewitt were
taken to the Khan's fort, four or five miles further
on the hills; where they found three or four European
soldiers, who had escaped from the slaughter,
wounded and taken prisoners. Some days after
five more Europeans were brought in, who had
proceeded in advance of our party. Major Griffith
opened a communication with Jellalabad; and was
in great hopes of effecting the release of the prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
on ransom: but, owing to the jealousy and
suspicion of the Khan Ghobam Jan Uzbezee, in
whose power they were, nothing could be arranged.
At last, after twenty days' confinement, he allowed
one of their party, Serg.-Major Lisson, 37th N. I.,
to proceed to Jellalabad, and endeavour to explain
matters. The party in all consisted of ten: two
of these died, and Capt. Souter was left wounded
at Tootoo.</p>

<p>The man who accompanied the Sergeant-Major
returned the third day, and told them all was right.
He was understood to have received 500 rupees
as the ransom of the Sergeant-Major, who remained
at Jellalabad. The party had strong
hopes of liberation: but unfortunately the Sirdar,
Mahommed Akbar Khan, heard of their being
prisoners and sent to demand them. After some
hesitation it was agreed to; and they were marched
off to Charbagh to the Sirdar, and from thence
to Buddeeabad.</p>

<p>Major Griffiths was severely wounded in the
right arm on the 8th of January, just at the
entrance of the Khoord Cabul pass; and, from
want of dressing, the wound had become very
painful the day he was taken prisoner.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Rain. We hear that the force under
Col. Wylde have fallen back on Peshawer; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
Gen. Avitabile, the Sikh General with them, has
been obliged to retreat to Attock.</p>

<p>I had again an opportunity, and wrote to Sale.</p>

<p>To-day all arms have been taken from the
officers, on a promise that they shall be restored
when we go away. I took poor Sturt's sword
myself and begged that the Sirdar would keep it
himself; that we might be sure of its restoration,
as being invaluable to his widow. Dost Mahommed
Khan, Abdool Guffoor Khan, &amp;c ., desired
me to keep it myself; acting in the handsomest
manner, and evincing much feeling on the occasion.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;The snow at Tézeen is reported to
be knee-deep. A very dismal day, with gentle
rain at night. The Europeans, who have arrived,
are all full of tales regarding each individual's
escape. Six of them, amongst whom was Serg.-Major
Lisson, of the 37th N. I., at daylight on
the morning after the final struggle at Gundamuk,
found themselves about a mile and half on the
Jellalabad side of Gundamuk; and perceiving some
Ghilzyes coming over the edge of a hill, they betook
themselves to a cave in the neighbourhood,
where they contrived to conceal themselves until
about 11 <small>A.M.</small>; when their retreat was betrayed
by the neighing of a horse belonging to one
of the men, which caused them to be discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
by a party of the enemy who were passing near
the mouth of the cave. These men came up, and
told them to come outside; which they refused to
do: the Ghilzyes then offered them bread, provided
they would pay for it; and they thus procured
three nans for forty-six rupees! The
enemy then again ordered them to come out of
the cave; and they replied, "In the evening, when
it gets dusk, we will come outside." They were
watched till then; and at that time gave themselves
up. They were immediately rifled of all the
money, &amp;c . they possessed; and then taken to a
fort in the neighbourhood, and afterwards transferred
to another, where they found Major
Griffiths; and from whence Lisson was despatched
to Jellalabad, to treat for terms of ransom, as
before mentioned.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;A fine day. Not content with the
arms given up, they pretend our servants have
others, and a general search took place to-day;
when all the poor wretches were fleeced of the
few rupees they had succeeded in securing on
their persons.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;This is the day that Mahommed Akbar
Khan is to go over the river towards Jellalabad to
attack it. The 13th sent a quantity of clothes
for distribution amongst the gentlemen. I received
a large packet of letters, both from my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
family in the provinces, and also from England,
but no note from Sale; so the Sirdar is still angry
about the private correspondence. It was a very
foolish attempt, for there was no news of consequence
to send; and rousing the Sirdar's suspicion
is not the way to make him kind to us.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;Firing of heavy guns distinctly heard
to-day; supposed to be a salute at Jellalabad.
Shah Shoojah is said to be still in the Bala Hissar;
and Zeman Shah Khan with Amenoollah Khan
in the city. They are said to be raising a force
to be sent by the former against Jellalabad; which
force is to be commanded by his son Futteh Jung.
To-day we hear that our horses are not to be
taken away from us; and every thing is to be
done to make us comfortable. There is an old
adage, that "Fair words butter no parsnips."</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;The ground was covered with snow
at daybreak; which continued to fall all day,
and also at night. At breakfast-time we distinctly
heard the report from three guns; and
about half an hour afterwards three or four heavy
discharges of musketry.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Dost Mahommed Khan came with his
son; the family have all arrived at a neighbouring
fort in this valley. There is a report that
Sale has chupaoed Mahommed Akbar Khan's
camp at Charbagh, and cut up fifty of his men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
<i>19th.</i>&mdash;I heard from Sale. A friend writes me
that there will be no relief before April. At
noon I was on the top of the house; when an
awful earthquake took place. I had gone up
stairs to see after my clothes; for, servants being
scarce, we get a sweeper, who also acts as saces,
to wash for us; and I hang them up to dry on
the flat roof: we dispense with starch and ironing;
and in our present situation we must learn to
do every thing that is useful. But to return to
the earthquake. For some time I balanced myself
as well as I could; till I felt the roof was giving
way. I fortunately succeeded in removing from
my position before the roof of our room fell in
with a dreadful crash. The roof of the stairs
fell in as I descended them; but did me no injury.
All my anxiety was for Mrs. Sturt; but I
could only see a heap of rubbish. I was nearly
bewildered, when I heard the joyful sound,
"Lady Sale, come here, all are safe;" and I
found the whole party uninjured in the courtyard.
When the earthquake first commenced in
the hills in the upper part of the valley, its progress
was clearly defined, coming down the valley,
and throwing up dust, like the action of exploding
a mine.&mdash;I hope a soldier's wife may use a soldier's
simile, for I know of nothing else to liken it to. Our
walls, and gateways, and corner towers, are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
much shaken, or actually thrown down. We had
at least twenty-five shocks before dark; and about
fifteen more during the night, which we spent
in the courtyard. The end wall of the room Lady
Macnaghten and party were in has sunk about
two feet, and all the beams have started.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;I wrote to Sale, to tell him we were
all safe. At 3 in the morning we had a pretty
smart shock; and constant ones, some severe, and
many very slight, on an average every half hour
all day, and five or six slight ones at night.
The gentlemen gave up their largest room to my
party, who were utterly roofless. Nearly all the
others slept outside: but we had only one crack
in the roof of our room, caused by part of the
wall falling on it. The cold outside was intense;
and the dew completely saturated the bed clothes
last night: added to which, should the buildings
come down, we were safer above, for the yard was
so crammed that, in case of accident, half the
people below must be crushed.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;At 1 in the morning a sharp shock
made us run to the door. We had numerous
slight, and three or four pretty good shocks: they
became more frequent in the evening. Part of our
party made awnings in the courtyard to sleep
under; but Mrs. Sturt and myself still preferred
the house as safest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
Dost Mahommed Khan brought workmen to
clear away the <i>débris</i>. He tells us our fort is the
best of forty that have suffered in this valley; and
that many are entirely thrown down. In one, a
tower fell, and crushed five women and a man:
others have not a wall remaining.</p>

<p>We have various reports regarding Jellalabad;&mdash;that
it has been taken, that the walls and all the
defences are thrown down, &amp;c .</p>

<p>Dost Mahommed says that a man was sent as a
spy to Jellalabad: that Macgregor sent for him;
and, with Sale, took the man round to show him
the state of the place: that two bastions had sunk
a little; but that they were not only able to withstand
Mahommed Akbar, but, if he came against
them, they would meet him in the plain. It is
said that Mahommed Akbar intends sending Gen.
Elphinstone away if he can get a palkee. Lady
Macnaghten has requested she may go with him;
being, she says, differently circumstanced from the
rest, who have most of them their husbands with
them. Not even an animal's life was lost in our
earthquake (I mean at our fort). Lady M.'s cat
was buried in the ruins, and dug out again.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;My wounds are quite healed. We had
earthquakes day and night; less severe, but equally
frequent. A prop was put up in our room to support
the broken roof. We experienced a curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
shock in the evening like a heavy ball rolled over
our heads. Some large pieces of hills have fallen,
and immense masses of stone. I miss some large
upright stones on the hills that divide us from
Kaffiristan, and that looked in the distance like
large obelisks.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;This has been a very close and gloomy
day; earthquakes frequent, and some very sharp
ones. We hear that, at Charbagh, 120 Affghans,
and 20 Hindostanees were buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>Capt. Bygrave arrived,with one of his feet severely
frostbitten: we were all rejoiced to see him, having
long supposed he had shared the fate of the many.
On the 12th of January, perceiving that our
army was utterly annihilated, he left the road at
midnight, turned to the left, and took to the
mountains; where he was out seven days and six
nights. During a part of this time he was accompanied
by Mr. Baness, the merchant from Delhi,
who had with him a small bag containing coffee:
on this they subsisted, taking each about six grains
a day. When this was spent Baness proceeded on;
and we afterwards heard that he got to Jellalabad,
but so worn out with fatigue that he only arrived
to die. Capt. Bygrave suffered greatly from
having his feet frostbitten: he however contrived
at daylight in the morning of the 19th to reach
Nizam Khan's village, called Kutch Soorkhab,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
about four miles north of Gundamuk, and twenty-eight
from Jellalabad. Here he remained (plundered
of course of what little money he had about him)
until the 14th of February; when he was sent for
to the Indian camp, then about six miles from
Jellalabad. He had been demanded some days
previously; but Nizam Khan refused to give him
up until the arrival of the second messenger,
accompanied by two mounted followers, when he
was obliged to comply. Bygrave reached the
Sirdar's camp in the afternoon of the 15th, and
remained there with him till the 21st, on which
day he started for Buddeeabad; and has, as before
remarked, this day joined the other prisoners.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Very few shocks, and those gentle ones:
but all last night, and great part of to-day, particularly
late in the evening, there was a tremulous
motion as of a ship that has been heavily struck
by a sea, generally feeling as if on the larboard
quarter, and accompanied by a sound of water
breaking against a vessel. At other times we have
just the undulatory motion of a snake in the water:
but the most uncommon sensation we have experienced
has been that of a heavy ball rolling over
our heads, as if on the roof of our individual room,
accompanied by the sound of distant thunder.</p>

<p>Abdool Ghyas Khan came to Buddeeabad. The
report is, that Sultan Jan was sent the day before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
yesterday with 1000 men to make a false attack
on Jellalabad; in which, on retreating, he lost
three men. Yesterday he was sent to repeat the
experiment, an ambuscade being planted by Mahommed
Akbar's order; and it is said that our
troops were led on to the spot in pursuit of the
fugitives; and that the enemy lying in ambush
attacked them, and cut up a whole regiment, of
which only three men escaped to tell the tale at
Jellalabad.</p>

<p>General Pollock with 5000 men is said to have
arrived at Peshawer, as commander of the forces
in Affghanistan, and with full political power.
The news came from a merchant, who has just
arrived from Peshawer.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;The earth is still unquiet, constantly
trembling, with reports like explosions of gunpowder,
but no severe shocks.</p>

<p>We hear that the camp followers we passed on
the road are eating the bodies of those that die:
eventually they must take their turn; for frostbitten
as they are, they never can leave the places
we saw them at.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;A man has arrived who confirms the
report of a fight, four days ago, at Jellalabad:
and says four of the 13th are killed, and four
taken prisoners; but they do not know whether
they are officers or men. Sultan Jan is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
have had a narrow escape, all his men having
been cut up.</p>

<p>Earthquakes very frequent, but not severe,
though worse than yesterday. The Ameer Dost
Mahommed is reported to be on his way up from
the provinces with the army; others say he has
escaped from Ferozepore.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;In consequence of a message from the
Sirdar, our guards are doubled. The Mirza Bowadeen
Khan is to go to him to-morrow. It is
said 8000 men are coming from Cabul. A smart
shock of an earthquake about 9 o'clock in the
evening; and during the night several slight
ones.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>&mdash;The Mirza went to the Sirdar.
Nothing has transpired. A smart double shock in
the morning, with slight tremulous motion.</p>

<p><i>3rd</i> &amp; <i>4th.</i>&mdash;Earthquakes as usual. To-day
every servant that is frostbitten or unable to
work has been turned out of the fort: they were
stripped first of all they possessed. I received two
notes from Sale, dated the 11th and 16th.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;At 3 <small>A.M.</small> turned out of bed by a smart
shock of an earthquake. Three continuous ones
at breakfast-time. Futteh Jung is reported to
be at Tighree.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;A letter arrived from Mahommed Akbar
Khan; stating that the King has written to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
desire that the force at Jellalabad may be withdrawn,
and that Futteh Jung is on his way down
with 8000 men. It is stated that Macgregor
has refused to receive the King's messenger; and
that our force have arrived at Jumrood.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Several slight shocks at night; after
which, great screaming and alarm. Husnoo, a
sweeper, being a disappointed man, attempted to
strangle Rookeria, a woman of the same cast. The
gentlemen searched every corner; and the delinquent
had to jump down the wall; in doing
which he seriously injured his back. There was
no other mode of escape, as we are always locked
into the square at night.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;The Affghans gave Mr. Husnoo a desperate
flogging; and had it not been for the officers,
would have hanged him afterwards: he was,
however, stripped, and turned out of the fort.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Dost Mahommed Khan came. Khoda
Bukeh, the half-brother of Mahommed Shah, has,
we are told, left the Sirdar, whose party is breaking
up; and he is supposed to be trying to get Major
Pottinger to make some terms for him with Macgregor,
and for him to join the English against
the King. Col. Palmer has sent down to Macgregor
the terms on which he will surrender at
Ghuznee; but Macgregor refuses to ratify them;
and has forwarded them to Gen. Pollock, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
the Sirdar, who has sent them here to Pottinger.
Meantime the garrison at Ghuznee are to be
provisioned by the chiefs. Dost Mahommed says
that the King has written to Macgregor to vacate
Jellalabad; and at the same time sent, by the
bearer of the letter, a verbal communication not
to do so. The messenger had a long conversation
with Macgregor, and then started sharp for
Cabul, passing Mahommed Akbar Khan's camp at
night; who, on his part, was expecting to catch
him in the morning, and possess himself of the
letters.</p>

<p>The Mirza Bowadeen Khan is getting a paper
signed by us all, to say he has treated us well:
from whence we suspect he thinks our party will
eventually gain the ascendant.</p>

<p>The Sirdar sent to Lady Macnaghten to say that
if she did not require the services of three Hindostanee
saceses that are in another fort, he will send
them, with the Resallah, to Peshawer on rafts, the
day after to-morrow: a demonstration of civility
without meaning. The saceses are useless at a
distance; and she does not require grooms for the
horses that have been taken from her, either by
him or Mahommed Shah Khan.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Earthquakes as usual. There has been
a fight at Jellalabad. A party were sent out to
mine: Sale, having intelligence of their intention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
planted an ambush. The enemy were first attacked
from the fort; and when they fled, they
fell into the ambuscade, and were cut to pieces.
Numbers of wounded Affghans have come into
this and the neighbouring forts.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Earthquakes in plenty. Mrs. Boyd was
confined early tills morning; adding another to our
list of female captives. In the evening Affghans
came in with many reports; confirming the account
that there have been three fights, in which
the Affghans have been worsted; that after the
last battle Mahommed Akbar Khan in his retreat
was fired at by an Affghan, and wounded in the
body and arms.</p>

<p>The Affghans tell two tales: one, that Shah
Shoojah had bribed a man with a lakh of rupees to
assassinate Akbar; the other, that Capt. Macgregor
gave Abdool Guffoor Khan (Akbar's cousin) the
same sum to procure the like effect; and that
Abdool and all his family have been put to death.</p>

<p>They say that Mahommed Akbar Khan chafes
like a lion taken in the toils, with his three wounds,&mdash;for
he was previously wounded in the thigh. He
allowed no one but Mahommed Shah Khan to
enter his tent.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;I was made very anxious by a report
that Jellalabad had been taken: it proved to be a
piece of wit, to impose on those who were eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
for news. The Mirza, as soon as he heard of it,
left his tent to come and assure me that it was
false, and to request I would not make myself unhappy
about it.</p>

<p>Of authentic accounts the last are, that there
was a burj between the Sirdar's camp and Jellalabad,
which Mahommed Akbar wished to establish
as an outpost, and intended taking possession of.
"Fighting Bob" (as Sale is called), having got
intelligence of their intentions, sent a party of
sappers and miners with supports during the
night, who destroyed the work and returned; and
on the Sirdar's party's arrival, they found their
intended post annihilated.</p>

<p>Further accounts regarding the Sirdar's wound
state, that it was purely accidental. A favourite
Pesh Khedmut, who had accompanied Mahommed
Akbar Khan to Bokhara, and had been with him
in all his changes of fortune, was assisting him to
dismount from his horse, when some part of his
dress catching upon his fire-arms, they went off,
and the Sirdar was wounded through the arm and
lungs. One account states, that the unfortunate
man was instantly cut to pieces; another, that he
was burnt alive; and that to the last he took his
oath on the Koran that the act was an accident.
There is nothing too brutal or savage for Akbar
to accomplish: he is known to have had a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
flayed alive in his presence, commencing at the
feet, and continuing upwards until the sufferer was
relieved by death.</p>

<p>The Mirza has sent for nalbunds to shoe our
horses; and there seems to be an idea that we
shall not long remain here. We have lately made
ourselves more comfortable: a temporary shed or
two, composed of mats, have been erected since the
great earthquake for the accommodation of those
who were turned out of their rooms at that time,
all of course at their own expense. We have also
got stools to sit upon, and charpoys instead of
lying on the ground; and a cujava, with boards
nailed on it, serves me for a table&mdash;a decided
luxury, there being but one other here. <i>Mirza</i>,
in this man's case, denominates a secretary: he is
a kind of under-jailor (Dost Mahommed Khan
being the principal one), who issues out our allowance
of food: to some he is civil, and has been so
to me: to some very rude; and has even drawn
his knife on one of the officers.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;We had two slight shakes, with reports
like distant guns or thunder in the morning; and
another during prayers at night. The Mirza
Bowadeen Khan is to leave us the day after to-morrow.
The servants have a report that there
have been several engagements, in which Sale
has been victorious; that the Sirdar is wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
in two places; and that the married people are
all to be sent to Jellalabad, and the bachelors to
Cabul.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;No earthquake to-day. The Mirza is
ordered off; and the Nazir of Mahommed Shah
Khan is come in his place: that is, he is to be our
sub-jailor, Dost Mahommed Khan being the principal
one, and answerable for our safe custody to
Mahommed Shah Khan, his brother, who rules
all Mahommed Akbar Khan's councils.</p>

<p>The Nazir begins well: says the Mirza cheated
us of our allowance; that two sheep and twenty
fowls are to be distributed daily, one seer of ottah,
and one of rice to each room, with ghee in proportion;
and that we are to have keshmish, sugar,
and tea, monthly.</p>

<p>It is further reported that the Sirdar never intended
the servants to be sent away; and that it
was done by the Mirza in hopes of obtaining
plunder. However, to do him justice, he sent to
Capt. Lawrence, desiring him to make it known
that the servants' money was unsafe; and that
those who had any had better intrust it to the
keeping of their masters. Now this he never
would have done had he intended to fleece them.
For myself I regret his going away; as he was
always very civil to me, getting me any little thing
I required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
<i>20th.</i>&mdash;During prayers (it being Sunday) about
one o'clock we felt three distinct shocks.</p>

<p>Numbers of cattle are being driven off towards
the hills. The people are sending their families and
property away from the villages. The Affghans
say that it is only the wandering Ghilzye tribes
returning, as is their wont in the spring of the
year, towards Cabul; having, as usual, wintered
their flocks in the warmer climate of the Lughman
valley.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The no-roz, or vernal equinox. Mr.
Melville brought us a bouquet of narcissuses,
which we highly prized, for it is long since we
have seen even a blade of grass.</p>

<p>The report of to-day is, that troops have at
length arrived at Jellalabad; having lost 1000 out
of 3000 men in forcing the Khyber pass. All the
forts about this place are filling fast with wounded
men of Akbar's army; and skirmishes are said to
take place daily at Jellalabad, in which we never
hear of the Sirdar being victorious.</p>

<p>A nalbund is come to this fort, and is shoeing
all our horses, we paying for the same. This
looks like preparation for a move; but we trust it
will not be a precipitate flight to Khoolloom with
Mahommed Akbar Khan, as we have heard it
hinted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
Mr. Clarke is stated to have arrived at Peshawer.
He is an active political functionary, and
just the man to set things to rights.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan sent 800 men to
watch the proceedings at Jellalabad. Sale is said
to have attacked them, and cut them to pieces.
This is the Affghan report of to-day.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;A report that the Sirdar is willing to go
over to the English; but that Mahommed Shah
Khan is averse to the measure.</p>

<p>Another report, that all the horses and ponies
are sent for by the Sirdar, has caused a great
commotion; which, however, has subsided, on
the discovery that the Sirdar had sent to claim a
blue horse he had lent Mr. Ryley on the march,
which he requires for his artillery: it was an iron
grey.</p>

<p>An earthquake early in the morning, and many
slight ones at night.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan's people are sounding us,
to ascertain whether we shall be ransomed or not;
talking of a lakh and half as our value: the
General, Major Pottinger, and Capt. Lawrence to
remain until we are in safety, and their rupees in
hand. A council of officers was held at the
General's regarding this same ransom business:
which they refer to Macgregor. I protest against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
being implicated in any proceedings in which I
have no vote.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;The Nazir says it was only a feeler,
and it was a lakh and half each that Mahommed
Shah Khan required from us. Perhaps this is
only a piece of Affghan wit.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;Letters from Jellalabad. The 31st, and
9th Queen's, a regiment of Dragoons, two of
Native Cavalry, eight of Infantry, three eighteen-pounders,
three nine-pounders, and six six-pounders,
are expected there on the 1st of April. Gerard
has been wounded. Abbott hit by a spent ball:
all well, thank God!</p>

<p>This news is very different from what we heard
this morning, which was that those left at Cabul
and Ghuznee have been sent to Bokhara to be sold
as slaves; and that our turn would come next.</p>

<p>The thermometer of our spirits has risen
greatly. We hear from Jellalabad that all at
Cabul are well, and that Ghuznee has been
obliged to surrender; but that the officers are all
well, safe, and taken care of, as we are here.</p>

<p>Earthquakes in the usual number.</p>

<p><i>27th.&mdash;Easter Sunday.</i> I wrote to Sale. Four
earthquakes before breakfast, and more at night.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;We hear from an Affghan, just come
from Jellalabad, that two regiments have left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
Peshawer, and advanced two marches; that Capt.
Mackeson, political agent, has bought over the
Khyberries; but that Gholab Sing, the Sheikh
general, has claimed the honour of keeping the
pass open for us.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;An Affghan reports that our troops have
arrived at Lallpoorah. A trifling earthquake at
sunset; the hills enveloped in clouds, which suddenly
assumed a lurid hue, and one sharp clap of
thunder much resembling a gun was heard; after
which they cleared off. A little rain about 8 <small>P.M.</small>
when it became very warm, and we experienced a
very hot night.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Sultan Jan and Mahommed Shah Khan
are (we hear) gone with 3000 men to oppose the
troops coming up. This force might annoy ours
very much in the Cholah Khyber, between Lallpoorah
and Hazar-i-now.</p>

<p>Another report is current to-day, that we are to
be off on Sunday for Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Heavy rain in the evening and at night, with
rumblings and trifling shocks.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;The weather has cleared up again. To-day's
report is, that we go on Monday to Tagow
or Kaffiristan. The people are becoming very
civil; ask if we will spare their lives, and are
sending their women away. We tell them that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
all who behave well to us will have their property
respected, and be well treated.</p>

<p>They say that Sultan Jan is really gone with
3000 men to the Cholah Khyber; that our force
coming up gives no quarter; that the Affghans
sent spies in the guise of country people, with
things to sell, to see what loot the Feringhees had.
They report that not only the soldiers, but also the
officers, are packed close in small palls, without
beds, chairs, tables, or any thing but the clothes on
their backs.</p>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;A famous hoax went round, that a
letter had come from Macgregor, that government
were going to ransom us from Mahommed Shah
Khan for three lakhs of rupees, and that we were
to leave Buddeeabad on Wednesday; that Sultan
Jan had been defeated in the Khyber, and that
Mahommed Akbar Khan had fled to Cabul.</p>

<p>Letters did actually arrive from Jellalabad subsequently,
with very conflicting accounts: Gen.
Pollock not expected till the 16th.</p>

<p>A report that Mahommed Akbar had withdrawn
all his outposts, and hostilities had ceased;
that Dost Mahommed had arrived at the Attock;
and that as soon as he entered the country,
all prisoners were to be set at large, and our force
to quit the country, leaving the Ameer Dost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
Mahommed to prosecute his fortunes as best he
may.</p>

<p>Sale's letter gives no intelligence of a public
nature; but as he proposes getting more shoes
made to send to me, it does not look as if he expected
us to leave this country soon.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;A report that Macgregor has seized a
flock of 200 sheep, twenty head of cattle, and
twenty camels that were passing near Jellalabad;
that Mahommed Akbar Khan, who it seems cannot
have withdrawn his outposts, sent to seize our
yaboos when they went out to water, and planted
a party for that purpose. Some of our people who
went out early, saw them stealing along to their
position, and immediately reported the circumstance,
when Sale planted an ambush of two companies,
one of Europeans and one native. They
then sent out the animals as usual, and when the
Affghans pounced on their expected prey, they
were attacked, and it is said 200 of them were
killed.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;I wrote to Sale, but heard that the letter
will not go till to-morrow. We are told that three
chiefs at Jellalabad are supplying our army with
grain, leaving it at the gate at night.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;The Nazir says that a brass six-pounder
has been brought in from the Khyber on a camel,
and that it has killed two camels bringing it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
Sirdar's camp; also, that they have brought in
thirty Europeans heads. Dost Mahommed Khan
has returned from Cabul; whither the Sirdar sent
him on business: he reports that there is great
commotion in Cabul; and he has brought all Sultan
Jan's family back with him for safety, to the
Lughman valley. The gun above alluded to, is
probably one taken at Ali Musjid; and the Sirdar
having brought it to his camp, induces us to think
that he has given up the idea of defending the
Khyber.</p>

<p>Pottinger gives it as his opinion, that we may
probably remain here for six months.</p>

<p>The Nazir tells us that the gun that has arrived
has been a month on the road, and has killed six
camels; that it is the one taken at Jumroad three
months ago, when our people were out foraging;
and that Zeman Khan has ordered Shah Shoojah to
send a force down from Cabul. What they are
going to do, and by whom the troops are to be
headed, we know not; but only that the report is
that a force has started. The Nazir told Pottinger
that the talk of our being ransomed at two lakhs
was only a feeler, to see what we would offer:
that Mahommed Shah Khan would for that sum
allow one gentleman to go to Peshawer to treat
with our party there; but that Pottinger would be
held answerable for his safe return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
News has just arrived to the Nazir from the
Kazanchey, who is with the Sirdar, that all the
officers at Ghuznee are killed except eight; that
our troops at Khelat-i-Gilzye hold their ground,
though they have been attacked several times;
that the garrison of Kandahar have made frequent
sallies, and scoured the country in every
direction for eight or ten miles; and that they
have got in a number of sheep and cattle: also,
that an army is coming up from Shikarpore.</p>

<p>Further reports assure us that Shah Shoojah
left Cabul to proceed to Bégramee, where his tents
were pitched; but that he had not got further
than the Musjed, where John Hicks's tomb is, in
front of the Bala Hissar gate, when he was cut
down in his palkee by the son of Zeman Khan,
and was immediately cut to pieces.</p>

<p>Three Sirdars are said to have come in to-day;
but we know of a truth that the Affghans are
burnishing up their arms, and making bullets.</p>

<p>Our force is reported to have arrived at Jellalabad.
Our guards are all on the alert. A report
that Mahommed Akbar is killed; another that
he has fled to Gundamuk.</p>

<p>Our broken towers are manned, and thirteen
men added to our guard.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;The first news this morning was, that
Mahommed Shah Khan had been here during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
night, and that he has removed his family from
the valley. It is still reported that Mahommed
Akbar Khan is dead. The Sirdar reproached the
chiefs for having supplied our garrison with provisions;
and the same night, Abdool Guffoor
Khan, Abdool Rahim, and Aga Jan, went over to
Macgregor with 1000 Affghan cavalry, and told
him that the enemy were not prepared; on which
a chupao was made on Akbar's camp, with great
slaughter. The three chiefs remained as hostages
in Jellalabad, whilst their men went with our
cavalry to chupao the camp. Akbar's horse was
restive; and none of his people waited for him:
his own artillerymen turned the guns against
him in their flight; and they left their camp standing,
their arms, and every thing they possessed;
and ran for their lives. Mahommed Shah Khan
has escaped; and Mahommed Akbar Khan is said
to be within four kos of Buddeeabad.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;We were hurried from daybreak to get
ready. Mahommed Shah Khan has taken away
all Lady Macnaghten's jewels, to the value of
above a lakh of rupees; and her shawls, valued at
between 30,000 and 40,000 rupees. He desired
to see my boxes; but did not take the trouble of
examining them: he, however, knew that I arrived
here without any baggage. He sent to inquire if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
we had any valuables; and, if so, we were to give
them up at once.</p>

<p>The Mirza has returned: he, and the Nazir,
promise to send a box, which I have no means of
carrying, as also our servants, who are unable to
go with us, to Jellalabad to Sale: however as
they crammed the box into their own godown, I
strongly suspect they mean to keep it themselves.
My chest of drawers they took possession of with
great glee&mdash;I left some rubbish in them, and
some small bottles, that were useless to me.
I hope the Affghans will try their contents as
medicine, and find them efficacious: one bottle
contained nitric acid, another a strong solution of
lunar caustic!</p>

<p>We did not start till past noon, and then did
not take the road we expected, leading to Tighree;
but an upper one to the right, and were told we
were going to Tagow. We had a great number
of detentions from the camels that carried the
kujavas; the General's broke down; so did Mrs.
Sturt's; the General was laid on the ground until
another could be brought for him; and Mr.
Melville gave his horse to my daughter. Here
the Mirza professed to be very kind and attentive:
he took a chogah lined with valuable
fur, which was particularly prized by Mrs. Sturt,
as being her husband's; also his sword; and said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
he would carry them for her when she was obliged
to ride; but he quite forgot to return them,
which caused much annoyance to us; and proved
that the Mirza, despite his fair speeches, took
care not to lose an opportunity of enriching himself
at our expence.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded far when we met some
horsemen shouting <i>Kal&#363;s shud</i>, and we were
ordered to turn round: then we heard that our
troops had been beat in the Khyber, and had lost
ten guns. The next report was, that our troops
had penetrated into the Lughman valley; another,
that Jellalabad was taken. We went back;
and found that the mat houses, and other little
comforts we had put up, were mostly demolished;
our scraps of setringees taken away, as also our
mats, &amp;c .: but the soldiers were very civil to us:
one brought back my charpoy, and busied himself
in stringing it for me; another brought me a
chiragh; and a soldier's wife brought Mrs. Sturt
and me each a stool to sit on. These little kindnesses
make a deep impression at such times.</p>

<p>We were told not to unpack; and to be ready
to start, if requisite, in the night.</p>

<p>A servant who refused to march with us was
all activity on our return: he ran here and there,
took our horses, and then, best of all, bought
some fowls and cooked them for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
We had been cooped up so long without any
exercise, that we were quite ready for and enjoyed
our dinner after the ride.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;We got an early breakfast; and soon
after started again; leaving the soldiers, two
European women (Mrs. Wade and Mrs. Burnes),
and the child Seymour Stoker, with all the
maimed servants, and those that would not go
with us. The women and child certainly ought
to have accompanied us.</p>

<p>We went to Ali Kund, a rather long march,
and found the Sirdar there, seated in his nalkee,
and looking very ill. He was particular in bowing
to us all, making every demonstration of civility.</p>

<p>Three tents were pitched for us on a pretty and
green spot. The valley was beautiful under cultivation;
and to us doubly so, from our not having
seen a blade of grass for so long a time.</p>

<p>The field pea was in blossom; several sorts of
cranesbill, gentian, forget-me-not, campions, &amp;c .</p>

<p>Having taken the precaution to have some
fowls roasted over night, we got a good meal;
and we design, whenever we march, and can procure
them, to do the same.</p>

<p>As we marched through the valley, we saw
the effects of the late earthquake: not a fort was
entire; very few habitable; and most of them
masses of ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
Sultan Jan arrived this evening from the Khyber.
Truly, the Persian expression of a man's face
being blackened is true: he looks very black upon
his late defeat in the Khyber; and has returned
with 50, all that remain to him of 500 men he
took there. I had no idea, before our captivity,
that people could become so changed by sunburn;
the Europeans looking like the Affghans, and the
Affghans as dark as Hindostanees.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Set out at eight <small>A.M.</small>, and arrived at
our ground at five <small>P.M.</small>; a very long march over
a sterile country. We only twice met with water,
which was very shallow, and so sandy that our
horses would not drink it. We did not see a
vestige of a habitation, nor any cultivation.</p>

<p>We left the Adanek Beeduck pass to our left;
and travelled up and down a number of very difficult
mountain passes. Mahommed Akbar Khan
passed us; bowed, and smiled&mdash;"He can smile,
and smile, and be a villain." I shook hands with
Moyenoodeen, who is also arrived from the
Khyber. He looks what is vulgarly called down in
the mouth. He appeared afraid of acknowledging
his acquaintance with me; and stealthily came to
inquire if my wound was well. He was with Sale in
the Kohistan; and then, and still, professes to be his
friend, and the friend of the English in general.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Made a march of about twelve miles:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
the country sterile and rocky; the road rather better
than yesterday; only one very awkward ascent,
when all the ladies got out of their kujavas. I
always ride; and have my own saddle: but some
of the ladies are obliged to ride gentleman fashion,
sitting on their beddings instead of saddles.</p>

<p>The road was mostly up and down hill. We
passed two small forts, with patches of cultivation
near them, not far from our encamping ground.
We found it very hot in our tent. This tent is
one division of a common Sipahee's pall. We
have taken up our places; and always retain them.
Our party consists of Mrs. Trevor and five of her
children, and Mrs. Sturt and myself, on one side;
on the other Mrs. Boyd and her three children,
Lady Macnaghten, Mrs. Mainwaring and child,
Capt. and Mrs. Anderson and two children, and
Capt. Lawrence. The other tents are similarly
crammed: all spread their beddings (which touch
each other) upon the ground.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;A very tiresome hill on setting out,&mdash;the
B&#257;dhpush or Windy Back: the ascent rather
difficult: the descent could be made good for guns
with 100 sappers in a few days. Saw plenty of
fruit trees in blossom on the hill; at the foot of
which we halted, dismounted, and sat on the
ground till all our people got over; and found
Mahommed Shah's sons with large bouquets of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
tulips. I observed the mistletoe, the myrrh, ilex,
&amp;c . The rest of the march was along a tolerably
good road. We crossed the same stream at least
twenty times. Saw some purple iris's. We
were detained a long time at the Cabul river;
which we crossed on a <i>jhala</i> (or raft) supported
on inflated skins; and encamped close to the bank,
but further down the stream, as the current was
very rapid: the river is said to be twenty feet deep
at some places. Here we found Mahommed Akbar
Khan. Our baggage came up at dusk, as also the
tents; but a great deal did not get over, and has
to wait for daylight. Several horses swam over;
and their efforts, and those of their riders, were
a source of great interest to us.</p>

<p><i>15th April.</i>&mdash;We did not leave our encampment
until the middle of the day; when we found
the sand dreadfully hot. We came only four or
five miles to Sehruby; and pitched our tents not
far distant from Abdoollah Khan's fort. There
were no kujavas to-day, and great grumbling
thereat amongst the ladies. A report, which we
fervently hope is untrue, that all the hostages left
at Cabul are murdered.</p>

<p>I saw plenty of amaryllis in bloom; as also of
the Persian iris (the orris of the druggists), which
quite scented the air with a perfume resembling
that of mingled violets and wall-flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
<i>16th.</i>&mdash;We halted. All manner of reports to-day,&mdash;that
the King has not been murdered, but
is in power with the Dooranees, the Populzyes,
and Akukzyes, who are in the ascendant; whilst
the Barukzyes are at a discount:&mdash;that great commotion
exists in Cabul:&mdash;that the soldiers, who
were left there, are to remain; but the officers
are to come and join us at Tézeen to-morrow;
whither we are to march, and go by roads impracticable
for cattle; all to walk, to Herat: we
are to be there in two months, after which we are
to be sent to Balkh.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Halted again, probably waiting for the
four kujavas that the Sirdar has ordered Mahommed
Shah Khan to furnish us with. They say
we go to Tezeen to-morrow: the mirza is off in advance,
in great haste. Our troops are said to be
near; and the Affghans are going to chupao them.
The Sirdar has fallen back on the river, to confer
with the Chief of Tagow.</p>

<p>This day I was attacked with fever.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Halted. Mahommed Shah Khan is
gone off to Cabul; we are to go to the hills
above Tézeen, and stay there till all is settled.
If only a small force comes up, the Affghans
mean to cut them up in the Khoord Cabul; if
a large force come, they will succumb at once.
I was worse to-day: a pleasant prospect, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
daily expect to march. Our troops are said to be
still at Lallpoorah, quieting refractory tribes.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;A miserable day, and we marched
through heavy rains to Tézeen: we are told
that no supplies were to be had where we
were. Kodá Buksh Khan's fort, close at hand,
is full of loot and plate. The earthquake has
brought down part of the fort they have brought
us to.</p>

<p>The Sirdar could only get two camels with
kujavas; but gave up his own palkee to Lady
Macnaghten and me. I was utterly incapable
of sitting on horseback: however, as I had to sit
backwards, with very little room, nothing to lean
against, and to keep a balance against Lady M.
and Mrs. Boyd's baby, I benefited but little,
except in the grandeur of a royal equipage. My
turban and habit were completely saturated by
the rain; and I shivered as I went. On arrival
at the fort, I was told to go into the room where
Mahommed Shah's and the other chief's ladies
were. They received us with great kindness; and
kept heaping up three large fires for us to dry
our clothes by. The court yard was a deep mass
of mud; and in the evening Affghans carried us on
their backs across it to another apartment, which
was nicely covered with <i>numdas</i>: our beddings were
all regularly sopped through. The whole of the baggage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
was sent on to the camp, with our servants.
A dinner was cooked for us,&mdash;a huge dish of rice,
with dhye (sour curds) in the centre, and ghee
poured over all! This is a favourite Affghan dish,
and therefore my bad taste must be arraigned for
thinking it not eatable. Fortunately I had a little
tea and sugar in a bag, suspended from the
crupper of my saddle: they gave us some milk,
and I found tea the most refreshing repast. We
stretched ourselves on the numdas (coarse felt
carpets) in our still wet clothes. In the night
I began shivering again; and Capt. Anderson, my
nearest bed mate, covered me with a bed cloak,
which, strange to say, soon imparted warmth to
me. We slept, large and small, thirty-four in
a room 15 feet by 12; and we lay on the floor,
literally packed together, with a wood fire in the
centre, and using pine torches for candles.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar fears if he is taken by us,
we shall either hang him or blow him from a gun.
Mahommed Shah Khan is in a great fright also.
Sultan Jan appears to be our bitterest enemy.
The Sirdar says <i>he alone</i> could take us through
the country: or, if he wished it, he could assemble
5000 men at any point to attack us.</p>

<p>It is said that Mackenzie is to go to Jellalabad
on a secret mission. He will not be allowed to
take any letters for individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
We had rain all day; and our wet chogahs, &amp;c .
hanging up, increased the damp. I wrote a few
lines in pencil to Sale by a trooper who expected
to go with Mackenzie, recommending both this
trooper himself (Oomar Khan), and the Rajah Ali
Bahadur to him: both have been very useful to
us. We had rain all day, and three earthquakes.</p>

<p>Mackenzie did not go after all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waller increased the community, giving
birth to a daughter: she, Mrs. Waller, and Mr.
and Mrs. Eyre got a room to themselves and
their children, diminishing our number to twenty-nine.
A slight earthquake, and a fine night.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;A fine sunshiny day: we went out to
camp; getting on the first horses we could find:
mine was a half-starved beast that could scarcely
put one foot before the other. We had scarcely
a mile to go. We hear that we are to halt here
one day; and then to go to Zenganah, where the
snow is four feet deep, and to stay there for four
months. Rain in the evening; and very heavy
rain at night. The General, who is said to be
dying, Pottinger, Mackenzie, Dr. Magrath, the
Eyres and Wallers, are left at the fort.</p>

<p>Major Pottinger expostulated with Akbar; and
told him that surely he did not make war on
women and children, and that it was great cruelty
to drive us about the country in the way they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
doing; that when the Dost and the ladies of his
family (amongst them Akbar's wife, the daughter
of Mahommed Shah Khan) went to Hindostan,
they travelled with every comfort procurable, and
probably many more than they would have experienced
in their own country. To this he replied,
I will do whatever you wish: but Mahommed
Shah Khan is gone to Cabul; the very bread
I eat I get from him; and until he returns I
cannot do any thing. He however insists that he
has a letter from Hindostan, in which it is asserted
that his father has twenty sentries over
him, and offered to show the letter to Capt. Lawrence;
who said he cared not who wrote the letter:
it was untrue:&mdash;that the Dost has a guard: but so
far from being a close prisoner, he being fond of
hawking, &amp;c ., goes out when and where he pleases,
with an escort of horse, which would be given in
compliment to his station, as in the case of the
royal families of Delhi, &amp;c .; and that any restraint
the women are placed under, is at the sole desire
of the Dost himself.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;We were roused before daylight with
orders to march immediately; and as we had fully
expected to halt for another day or two, all was
confusion.</p>

<p>I was still too weak to ride; and Mrs. Boyd
kindly gave me her place in the kujava, I carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
her baby. It was my first attempt, and the conveyance
was a particularly small one of the kind; for
when the resai was put in to sit on, there was not
one foot and a half square; and I found (being
rather a tall person) the greatest difficulty in
doubling up my long legs into the prescribed compass.</p>

<p>On inquiry, I found that our departure was occasioned
by the arrival of a letter from Cabul;
stating that Futteh Jung, son of the deceased
Shah Shoojah, was coming with 400 horse to
carry us off, as a card to play in his own favour.</p>

<p>Zeman Shah Khan, acting-King in Cabul, also
demands us. Akbar wants to keep us: but both
he and we are in the hands of Mahommed Shah
Khan; who says he never took place or present
from us; that he hated us always; and will be our
enemy to the last.</p>

<p>We came to-day about twelve miles up the
bed of a deep ravine, crossing the stream at
least fifty times. From our last encampment we
could see Kodah Buksh Khan's fort, looking very
pretty, surrounded with fine trees in blossom.</p>

<p>On first starting, we passed on our right a large
mountain-slip, caused by the earthquake near to a
cave, where there are a great number of bodies.
The hills were very precipitous on our left, and
high on both sides. We also passed a cave at some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
small distance, in front of which were some dead
bodies and many bones strewed about: and, from
the blood close to its entrance, there is every
reason to believe that the inhabitants were supporting
nature by devouring each other. I saw
three poor wretches crawling on hands and knees
just within the cave: but all we had to bestow
upon them was pity, not unmingled with horror at
the evidences of cannibalism but too apparent.
These miserable creatures called to us for that
relief which we had it not in our power to afford;
and we can only hope that their sufferings were
speedily terminated by death.</p>

<p>No guns excepting those of the mountain train
could travel this road; and cavalry and infantry
would be greatly annoyed from the heights.</p>

<p>We did not go direct up the Tézeen valley;
but took the right hand valley, which leads to
the Jubhar Khail country, considered as the
strongest of the Ghilzye mountain fastnesses. We
passed an old Ghilzye fort on an eminence on our
right; also a small colony of charcoal makers,
resident in mud huts, and encamped at a second
place of the same kind. Ice six inches thick in
places close to the road; and plenty of snow from
six to eight inches deep on the sides of it.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>&mdash;Being still very weak, I am glad to hear
we are likely to halt here eight days. Khojeh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
Mahommed Khan seems very anxious regarding
some terms being made with the Feringhees:
the <i>bahadurs</i> notwithstanding; and says he can
bring two lakhs of fighting men against us.</p>

<p>The Ghazeeas are getting discontented; and
complain that they have had no food for four days.</p>

<p>The Sirdar has ordered our horses back to
Tézeen: he says he cannot feed them here.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;The General died last night, and his
remains are to be sent to Jellalabad. Mackenzie
was sent there on a secret mission just afterwards.
The General's death was hastened by a rumour
of a Chupao from Cabul the very day we left
Tézeen. At mid-day all were put on horseback,
and sent off to a fort near at hand. In the
general hurry to save themselves, Mrs. Waller,
with her two children, seemed to be quite forgotten.
Mr. Waller went to Major Pottinger,
who was mounted on his horse, and who said all
must do the best they could for themselves; but
that no doubt accommodation would be given.
On this Mr. Waller, who cannot speak Persian,
applied to Capt. Mackenzie; who went to Akbar
Khan, and represented to him how shocking a
thing it was to leave a lady and two children to
have their throats cut. An old kujava was found,
and strung; and some Affghans carried it on a
pole. Three wives of one of the chiefs were also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
left in a great fright; but they procured some
conveyance also. Pottinger was hurried off in
such haste that he could not remonstrate.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan says he will not give
us any thing besides ottah. I suppose he keeps
all the good things for the Affghan ladies;
some of whom inhabit two mud huts on the hill,
and the others are lodged in black tents more
fragile than our own. Mahommed Rufeek, our
present keeper and purveyor, has purchased twelve
sheep on his own account for us; and Mahommed
Akbar Khan has sent twelve camels to Cabul to
bring rice and ghee. We are also busy making
chebootras: we hang up our resais and blankets
for roof and walls, and find they make very comfortable
places to sit in all day.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;A report that Macgregor is to exchange
us against an equal number of Affghan ladies and
children at Loodianah; and that we are to be
released in a few days.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;A report to-day that the Jellalabad
army are moving upwards and the Cabul one
downwards. The Affghans say that their force
consists of 11,000 men.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar and Major Pottinger paid us
a visit. The former tells us we are not to be
angry; that nothing is procurable here; that he
has sent to Cabul for every thing for us. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
brought some native shoes and cloth for distribution.
Miller and Moore, the two soldiers who
attended on the General, have been liberated: but
Akbar says that it is not prudent to let them go at
present, as the roads are unsafe!</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;We have converted our chebootras into
arbours made of juniper. We were driven from
ours to-day before dinner by a shower of rain.
At night we had thunder, hail, and showers of
rain, that came on in gusts.</p>

<p>It is said that the Sirdar has intercepted a letter
from Conolly to Macgregor regarding some treaty
with Amenoollah Khan for 3 lakhs: and that
Kohundif Khan (the Dost's brother), with 8000
Persians, is moving on Kandahar. If this is true,
it involves a quarrel with Persia.</p>

<p>A number of the Sirdar's men are said to have
gone off to-day; having struck for arrears of pay.
The Sirdar offered them 5 rupees each, but they
demanded 10. A relief guard of seven men has
arrived with some petty chief.</p>

<p>We have just heard that Miller was disguised
as an Affghan to lead the camel that conveyed the
General's body. Moore looked too English to
attempt it. Near Jugdaluk, the party of ten
horsemen were attacked, and the box, which was
supposed to contain treasure, broken open. We
at first heard that they had mutilated the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
old man's body; but only a few stones were thrown,
one of which struck the head.</p>

<p>Miller was beaten a good deal, and wounded
with a knife; but saved his life by saying he was
a Mussulman: he had to return. The body was
sent on; but I believe there is as yet no authentic
account of its arrival at Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan arrived at night.</p>

<p><i>30th April.</i>&mdash;A messenger came in from Amenoollah
Khan. The government have refused to
pay the 14½ lakhs; and the Affghans say that
Pottinger and Lawrence are answerable for it. Is
not Akbar more answerable for the non-fulfilment
of the treaty? he who went to the Durbar, booted,
(on the 7th of January,) ready to start after our
army for the avowed purpose of its annihilation?</p>

<p>The Rajah has come in; he goes off to Cabul
again to-morrow. Goolam Moyen oo deen also
came to see us: he goes with the Sirdar to Tézeen
to-day.</p>

<p>All accounts seem to agree in this: that although
the Affghans are raising troops in Cabul, yet
they seem to be as likely to fight against each
other as against us.</p>

<p>Our soldiers who were left at Cabul, have been
sent to Logur (Amenoollah's country). The
hostages are placed in the hands of the son of the
high priest, Bucha-i Meer Wyse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
It is reported that the Dost has written to Akbar
Khan to say, that, if there is any chance of regaining
the throne, he was to fight for it; but if not, not
to drive us women and children about the country;
as it was against his interest that we should be ill
treated. Perhaps he pities the wives of all these
Ghilzye chiefs, who go wherever we do: they
however have the best and largest kujavas, and
plenty of them; whilst with us, many ladies very
unfit to ride, are forced to do so, and even without
side or any saddles; for myself, I would rather walk
than be again packed into a kujava.</p>

<p><i>1st May.</i>&mdash;Futteh Jung, Amenoollah, and the
Populzyes are in the Bala Hissar. The new
king, Zeman Shah Khan, and Osman Khan, with
the Barukzyes, are in the city. They have
sixteen guns; and want the former party to join
them; but they refuse to do so, saying that the
others inveigled Shah Shoojah out, and killed him.</p>

<p>Neither party will have any thing to do with
Akbar; who, they say, plays a double part, and
killed all our army. Mahommed Shah Khan wants
to get Akbar to Cabul: but he refuses to go, from
dread of assassination.</p>

<p>He (Akbar) wishes to be made a consequential
chief of some part of the country; and would probably
give us up, had he the power: but Mahommed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
Shah Khan is very powerful, and averse
to the project.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;All Cabul is in an uproar, the people
fighting amongst themselves. Khojeh Mahommed
took some of the officers out shooting: whilst on
the hills, they heard the report of guns; and were
told that the firing was at Cabul; about thirty
miles off in a direct line.</p>

<p>In a conference with Pottinger, Troup, and
many other English and Affghans,&mdash;amongst
the latter Mahommed Shah Khan,&mdash;Mahommed
Akbar Khan became greatly excited. He
said, that on the religious cry being raised, he
killed the Envoy, he destroyed our army; and
now that he has drawn down the vengeance of the
British upon him, the rest are deserting him: that
he has kept his feelings pent up within his own
breast, until they have preyed upon his vitals; and
that, were he in power now, he would exterminate
every one of the recreant Mussulmans who have
deserted him, and left him to obloquy.</p>

<p>A cossid has arrived from Cabul; where there
has been a fight, in which Zeman Shah Khan has
been victorious. One of Amenoollah's sons is
killed; and Hamza Khan is wounded: but Futteh
Jung and Amenoollah are still in possession of the
Bala Hissar.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Amenoollah Khan has been worsted. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
Sirdar has sent troops, under his cousin Shamshudeen,
to lay waste the Logur country, destroy the
forts, and capture the women: for all which Akbar
promises a reward of 30,000 rupees.</p>

<p>It is now reported that we are to go in three or
four days to Ghuznee, where the Sirdar's cousin
Shumshudeen commands. I heard from Sale.
The Wallers and Eyres arrived from Tézeen.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar is gone or going to Cabul.</p>

<p>Capt. Troup is just summoned to join him and
Pottinger: Magrath remains at Tézeen; and Mackenzie,
they say, is gone back to Jellalabad again.</p>

<p>Another account states that Amenoollah has
fled to the Logur country, and that Futteh Jung
holds the Bala Hissar. Further accounts state
that Amenoollah, although defeated, got safe into
the Bala Hissar. 200 horsemen have been sent
from Cabul to the Sirdar: Zeman Shah Khan
invites him to assume the throne. He was sleeping
when they arrived; but the prospect of a crown
soon chased his slumbers; and he was quickly on
horseback with Pottinger, leaving orders for Troup,
on his arrival, to follow. Mackenzie was not to
go to Jellalabad; but to wait half way for further
orders from the Sirdar.</p>

<p>The Sirdar has been urgent (but ineffectually
of course) with Mr. Eyre to go to Cabul to lay
his guns for him. We hear that the hostages are
all again with Zeman Shah Khan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
<i>7th.</i>&mdash;I have before adverted to Mackenzie's
secret mission to Jellalabad. It was first, to
ascertain what terms our party would propose:
the reply was an offer of two lakhs of rupees for
all the prisoners, and that the sooner we were
given up to our own people the greater would be
the friendship of our government; that, in consequence
of the protection afforded us by Dost
Mahommed Khan, and Mahommed Shah Khan,
their families and possessions would not be attacked:
but that the grand question of peace or
war, and the settlement of the country, must depend
upon replies to be received from the Governor-General.
The Sirdar has sent in his rejoinder
by Mackenzie; saying, he does not want money;
nothing but the friendship of our nation; and that
if the ladies and children go, he cannot part with
the gentlemen yet.</p>

<p>Gen. Pollock has issued a proclamation, that
whoever remains quiet will be unmolested.</p>

<p>Threats are held out that if our troops move up
higher than Gundamuk, we shall also be taken
20 miles further up into the hills. To this there
are two objections: we are now above the Tézeen
valley, in the Jubhar Khail country; these people
declare we shall not go further, or if we do they
will themselves take us to our army, for they do not
want to bring down upon themselves the vengeance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
of our nation; secondly, we have no carriage: there
is little doubt, that Mahommed Shah Khan would
care little for our being obliged to leave behind
our clothes and the few comforts we have, but we
cannot be expected to walk; and the Sirdar or
some of the chiefs have taken away to Cabul both
our riding horses and baggage ponies.</p>

<p>I consider myself fortunate in having had
my horse selected to carry Capt. Mackenzie to
Jellalabad: it arrived there lame, and was left
with Sale. We have this day seen the general
order with Col. Palmer's capitulation at Ghuznee;
and dreadful was the tale that shortly followed it.
On the faith of the orders received, and the promises
of the treaty with the chiefs, these devoted
troops left Ghuznee, under the charge of Shumshudeen
(the Sirdar's cousin). Treachery seems to be
inherent in the blood of this family.</p>

<p>A Ghazeea shot an officer, another shot the
Ghazeea; a fight ensued; the whole of our troops
were cut up; exertions were made to save the officers,
but every Sipahee fell. Seven of the officers
are said to be alive, and poor Mrs. Lumsden. It is
exactly the counterpart of what occurred with the
Cabul force.</p>

<p>Regarding our climate.&mdash;The snow has melted
on the hills immediately in our front and rear;
but the tops of those within a moderate walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
(were we permitted to go out of the bounds assigned
to us for exercise) are still covered with it.</p>

<p>This morning, when we were dressing, and long
after sunrise, the Bheestee took his mushk to the
stream, not 50 yards from our tents, and filled it:
on his return the water was frozen so hard he could
not pour it out; and we had to thaw it by the fire.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;A very gloomy day, and cold: we kept up
a good fire in the bower. A little snow fell.
Serj. Deane's wife, a Persian woman, has been
taken by force and married to a younger brother of
Mahommed Shah Khan. Whenever this man
enters her presence, she salutes him with her slipper.
It is only within a few days that she has been
told of Deane's death: she appears to have been
sincerely attached to him; and is represented as a
very pretty young woman.</p>

<p>The man who took the General's body to
Jellalabad has returned. He seems highly pleased
with the present he has received of 200 rupees:
and it appears to have had a good effect; for he
reports in glowing terms on the grand turn-out for
the funeral, the salvoes fired, &amp;c . on the occasion;
and the magnificent appearance of our troops.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Capt. Anderson's little girl was restored,
to the great joy of her parents.</p>

<p>Parties run high at Cabul: Zeman Shah Khan
says he will be King, Akbar ditto, Jubhar Khan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
the same, and Amenoollah has a similar fancy, as
also Mahommed Shah Khan, and Futteh Jung
the Shah-zada.</p>

<p>The troops go out daily to fight; Amenoollah's
to Ben-i-shehr, and Zeman Shah Khan's to Siah
Sung; they fight a little, and then retreat to their
own positions. Zeman Shah Khan has been driven
out of his house, and Amenoollah out of his; but
have part of the town in their favour.</p>

<p>The citizens are ruined by the perfect stagnation
of trade; and would probably side with us were
we to show in force. Now is the time to strike
the blow, but I much dread dilly-dallying just
because a handful of us are in Akbar's power.
What are <i>our</i> lives when compared with the
honour of our country? Not that I am at all
inclined to have my throat cut: on the contrary, I
hope that I shall live to see the British flag once
more triumphant in Affghanistan; and then I have
no objection to the Ameer Dost Mahommed Khan
being reinstated: only let us first show them that
we can conquer them, and humble their treacherous
chiefs in the dust.</p>

<p>There have been a number of reports to-day,
which I believe to have no foundation in truth:
amongst others, that the Ghilzye ladies have been
packing up all night; and are going to give us the
slip and leave us, in consequence of hearing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
our force is coming up in four divisions; one of
which arrived at Tézeen at four this morning, and
looted the place: and that we are to be sent forty
kos higher up into the hills. This is, however,
contradicted, as some persons who were sent out
yesterday to explore have returned, and say that
the snow is two feet deep and impracticable.</p>

<p>A letter arrived from the Sirdar; stating that
whenever it might be requisite for us to move,
he would send us camels, ponies, and all the carriage
we require; and that we are positively not
to move without his especial order.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Futteh Jung wrote to his brother Timor
at Kandahar to come and assist him: Timor sent
him 3000 Juzailchees; and assured him that he
was himself coming up with the British army.</p>

<p>Major Pottinger writes that there is no present
chance of our liberation.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan professes that he does
not want money from us; but he laughs at our
offer of two lakhs for the whole party; and has
sent back to say he wishes for eight. It has been
recommended that we should offer him five; but the
general opinion is that we shall remain in captivity
till all is settled.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;The Akhonzada says, that, after we left
Buddeeabad, all the natives were turned out, and
told they might make the best of their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
to Jellalabad; being first stripped of their clothes
and all that they possessed. Those who had lost
their feet of course could not attempt it; and the
greater part of the rest, we are told, have been
taken as slaves.</p>

<p>We have a slave merchant here now. We learn
that men sell for forty-six rupees, and women for
twenty-two, each: they are sent off to Khoolloom.
400 Hindostanees have been entrapped at Cabul,
under an assurance of safe conduct to Jellalabad.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;People have come in from the Lughman
valley, who report that the wheat and barley
there are ripe, and also the mulberries. Here the
crops have not attained the height of six inches.</p>

<p>The booming of heavy guns heard: on which
the guard here said the Kulma; hoping that it
was something in the Sirdar's favour.</p>

<p>It is reported that Futteh Jung is King, the
Sirdar Wuzeer, and Zeman Khan Sirdar-i-Sirdaran.
About thirty shots were heard in the
night.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;More of Mahommed Rufeek's people
have come in from Cabul: they say that Mahommed
Akbar Khan is proclaimed King, until his
father's return; that he resides at present in the
Ben-i-shehr; and that Amenoollah has free ingress
and egress to and from him, for the purpose of
meeting with Futteh Jung. The Sirdar has sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
for all our horses, ponies, &amp;c . The Naib Shureef
has sent Mrs. Sturt and me tea and sugar:&mdash;a
kind attention and great comfort.</p>

<p>Akbar says he will fight our army. This is expressed
in a letter written to Suballan Khan, the
captain of our guard. Dost Mahommed Khan
asserts that it is Major Pottinger who retards our
release: but he is as much a prisoner as ourselves.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;I kept the anniversary of my marriage by
dining with the ladies of Mahommed Shah Khan's
family; who told us that Futteh Jung was King,
Mahommed Akbar Khan Wuzeer, and Mahommed
Shah Khan the Sirdar-i-Sirdaran. It was an
extremely stupid visit. We had two female
servants to interpret for us. Three of Mahommed
Shah Khan's wives and some of Dost Mahommed's,
with the mother of the chiefs, and two of their
unmarried sisters, were present. They were,
generally speaking, inclined to <i>embonpoint</i>, largely
formed, and coarsely featured; their dress inelegant,
and of the coarsest materials. The favourite
wife, and the best dressed, was attired in
a common Cabul silk, with a coarse piece of
chintz inserted behind, evidently for economy's
sake. The dress, which covers the whole person,
nearly resembles a common night-dress; and has
tacked on to it coins, or other pieces of silver or
gold, such as crescents, &amp;c ., all over the sleeves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
the front and sides, from the shoulders to the
feet. A breast-plate is worn, commencing at the
throat, of coins strung together: this descends far
below the waist; and when they sit down, it hangs
in festoons on the lap. Only the favourite wore gold
coins; those of the other ladies being of silver. They
had nothing in the way of jewels, properly so called.
About seven common-sized pearls surrounding an
emerald full of flaws, the whole set as a nose
ornament, was the handsomest thing I saw in the
trinket way. Some of them had very inferior
earrings of gold and silver. They wear their hair
in innumerable small plaits hanging down: these
are arranged once a week after taking the bath;
and the tresses are then well stiffened with gum.
The unmarried women bend their hair in a flat
braid across the forehead touching the eyebrows;
which gives them a very heavy look. These said
eyebrows, whilst they are maidens, remain as nature
formed them: but when they marry, the hair of
the centre is carefully picked out; and the arch,
thus most unnaturally raised, is painted. The
Cabul women are much addicted to the use of both
white and red paint; and they colour not only the
nails, as in Hindostan, but the whole hand up to
the wrist, which looks as though it had been plunged
in blood, and to our ideas is very disgusting.
A particular plant is often used for this purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
The upper part of the leaf sparkles, and resembles
the ice plant; but the lower side is red, and on
being pressed gives a fine dye. A chuddah is
thrown over the head and shoulders in the house,
as in Hindostan; and when they go out they wear
the bourka, ru-i-bund, and legwraps: high-heeled
iron-shod slippers complete the costume. After a
time an extremely dirty cloth was spread over the
numdas in front of us, and dishes of pillau, dhye
or sour curd, and férnéz or sweet curd, were
placed before us. Those who had not taken a spoon
with them, ate with their fingers, Affghan fashion;&mdash;an
accomplishment in which I am by no means <i>au
fait</i>. We drank water out of a tea-pot. A dinner
was given to the gentlemen by Abdoollah Khan
at his tents about two miles off, nearer the snow.</p>

<p>In the evening Capt. Mackenzie arrived; and
I received a letter from Sale.</p>

<p>There seems to be no present prospect of release.</p>

<p>We hear that the force under Gen. Nott has
been reinforced by Brig. England; who had nevertheless
been beaten back in the first instance:&mdash;that
Gen. Nott was to march towards Cabul as
yesterday (the 15th); and that Gen. Pollock was
still awaiting orders from Lord Ellenborough; but
that whether they arrive or not, we must now wait
until Nott's force gets near to Cabul to make a
simultaneous attack. Now as Akbar only boasts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
12,000 men against us, and as we have fully that
number at Jellalabad, with 18-pounders, Pollock's
force would easily capture Cabul in the present
position of affairs. A short time ago it would have
been still easier, as there was then more division
among the Affghan troops.</p>

<p>A letter from Mahommed Akbar Khan to
Sultan Khan has been intercepted; in which he acknowledges,
that for every rupee he can muster, the
Shah-zada (Futteh Jung) can produce a gold mohur.</p>

<p>An European and some natives were murdered
near our camp at Jellalabad: and, vigorous
measures not being taken, the offence was
repeated; and a duffodar of Tait's horse fell a
victim to the Affghans. On the murderer taking
refuge in a village, Tait immediately surrounded it
with his men; and then reported the circumstance
to Gen. Pollock; who, after consulting with Capt.
Macgregor, sent to tell the people of the village
that if they did not, within a specified time, give
up the malefactor to be hanged by us, he would
burn the village, and put every living being in it
to death. The time had not expired when this
news came. Cruel as an action of this kind may
appear, it is probably the best method of striking
terror into these savages, and perhaps of eventually
preventing bloodshed.</p>

<p>Capt. Mackenzie has brought me intelligence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
Sale's having broken three of his ribs, from his
horse falling with him; and that he has suffered
also from inflammation in consequence of the accident;
but that he is fast recovering, if not, as he
says he is, quite well and fit for work again.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;I heard this morning that part of my
letters regarding the siege had arrived in England,
and been laid before the Court of Directors.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Lady Macnaghten and a part of the
ladies breakfasted with Dost Mahommed Khan
and his ladies. They were told that, if the Sirdar
gains the Bala Hissar, we shall all go there; if
not, we go to Jellalabad.</p>

<p>One report states, that the Sirdar, who is resident
at Ben-i-shehr, was to meet Futteh Jung on
amicable terms; but that the latter refused to go
outside the Bala Hissar until Mahommed Shah
Khan and Sultan Jan were given up to him as
hostages, which was done: but when Futteh Jung
got as far as the Musjid, finding Akbar at the
head of 3,000 men, fearing treachery, he retreated,
shut the gates, and fired on Akbar's
party. Another account states, that when the
gates were opened for Futteh Jung to go out,
Amenoollah released the hostages, and then went
over to the Sirdar himself. Mackenzie is supposed
to be at Tézeen to-day; and will be here either
to-morrow or in three days. It is worthy of remark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
that during Lady Macnaghten's visit to the
ladies this morning, Dost Mahommed Khan was
present the whole time; which was decidedly, according
to Affghan custom, an insult; as the men
never are present when their wives receive company.</p>

<p>A Kandaharee female servant of these ladies
told them in Hindostanee not to believe a word that
Dost Mahommed said to them; as his intelligence
was all false and was intended to mislead them.</p>

<p>A storm of thunder and rain at dinner-time: in
the evening we ascended the hill, about 150 feet;
and then found the view bounded by another: so
we fatigued ourselves to no purpose. A fire beacon
lighted on the hill at night.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Lady Macnaghten and two other ladies
breakfasted with Khojeh Mahommed Khan's family;
and on this occasion two men were present. The
rest of us were not invited.</p>

<p>Khojeh Mahommed sighed much and seemed out
of spirits. According to the statement of their
servants, the ladies have not had food cooked for
them for two days in consequence of their grief.
In these parties they do not eat with the Kaffirs;
but are profuse of their expressions of good will;
and desire us to ask them for any thing we require.</p>

<p>Their professions were put to the test; at least
those of Dost Mahommed himself: a gentleman
asked for a chillum, and was told to go to the devil
(Goom Shud).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
I received two notes from Sale dated the 15th;
informing me that he had received a highly gratifying
letter from Lord Ellenborough, and another
from Sir Jasper Nicholls, regarding the holding of
Jellalabad, the chupao on Akbar's camp, &amp;c .; and
stating that the 35th were to be made light infantry;
the Company's troops to have medals, and
to bear "Jellalabad" and a mural crown on their
colours: also that Lord Ellenborough would request
Her Majesty's permission that the 13th should be
similarly honoured.</p>

<p>Chintz, sugar candy, tea, and cheese, distributed
amongst the ladies; they were sent to us by our
friends at Jellalabad: also Shalu (Turkey red
cotton cloth) and jean, with boots and shoes for
the gentlemen. We also received the March overland
mail. I heard a droll anecdote of Akbar
when he went off to Cabul from Tézeen. His followers
asked him what tent they should take for
him: his reply was given with great good humour
(he believed himself on the point of mounting a
throne);&mdash;"The ladies and people above have got
all our tents here; but you may send my salaam to
Gen. Sale, and ask him to lend me one of those
he took from me."</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;The first thing we heard this morning
was, that ponies had arrived and that we are
going to Cabul. They afterwards told us that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
we are going to Shéwakee, a fort near the Pillar.
The officers went to Dost Mahommed and informed
him that only thirty-three ponies had arrived, and
no camels; and that it was impossible we could
move without more means of transport: so the
order to march at mid-day was rescinded; and we
have been promised animals to start with early
to-morrow morning. We are to go to Khoord
Cabul, seventeen miles, as our first march.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>&mdash;Mules arrived for three kujavas; but no
camels, as we take a road that is bad for these
animals.</p>

<p>Started at a little before 10 <small>A.M.</small>, and got to
the fort we formerly went to at Khoord Cabul,
at 6 <small>P.M.</small> We travelled fully twenty-two miles,
following the road to Tézeen, by which we came
to Zanduh, for some time, and then turning to
the left. Except in a few places the road was
tolerable. We crossed a highly cultivated valley
studded with forts; a perfect oasis in our barren
mountain track. The yellow briar-rose is in
bloom, and asphodels of three different colours,
yellow, pink, and a greenish brown, a pretty description
of borage, and a plant resembling sage
with a red flower; and blue sage in blossom was
found amongst the wells and stones. The climate
here was much warmer than at Zanduh. We did
not strike into the regular road till we arrived at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
the Huft Kotul; and here we came upon a sad
scene of decaying bodies, amongst which poor
Major Ewart's was still recognisable.</p>

<p>There is a fort opposite to the point where the
short road turns back to Seh Baba; and another
at Thana Tariffa, which is the entrance to the
Thungee on the Jellalabad side. This was
also dreadful to go through; both to the sight and
smell equally offensive.</p>

<p>Immediately after emerging from the pass,
we took a short cut to the left of the regular
road, which brought us to the fort. In its immediate
vicinity there was rich cultivation; but
a great deal of land formerly tilled lies fallow this
year.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;We left the fort at about the same time
as yesterday: our march was eighteen or nineteen
miles over hill and dale, with a rich valley but
scantily cultivated on our left. We had a difficult
ascent over a rocky hill; after which we passed
a tope which has no appearance of having been
opened. There is a fine tank nearly opposite to it,
shaded by trees, and containing small fish: it is
supplied with beautifully clear water from the
Karez, near it; from which, I suppose, it takes
its name of Káreza. We then pursued our way
over a plain, covered with stones, till we ascended
a difficult rocky hill, which was surmounted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
famous Pillar generally ascribed to Alexander
the Great. It is evidently not of Affghan workmanship;
and is now out of the perpendicular,
leaning back, as if it shrank from Cabul. The
outer casing is quite gone; and it is not therefore
wonderful that no inscription exists: and the
greater part of the square base it rested on has
also mouldered away. From this spot there is a
magnificent view. Immediately below us was a
richly cultivated country studded with forts and
fruit trees, the Logur river, beyond it the Siah
Sung, and a distant view of Cabul, and then ranges
of hills, the whole bounded by the mountains of
Kohistan and the Hindo Koosh, covered with perpetual
snow. The descent on the Cabul side
is rather more difficult in parts; particularly when
you have not an acquaintance of long standing
with your horse; which was my case, having hired
for the day a mere baggage pony, for the large
sum of two rupees six anas. The creature was
evidently not used to scrambling; and did not
like it. Whenever he came to a difficult place,
he jumped down with his two fore feet; and then
considered whether he should bring the hinder ones
after them; and in this way jumped up on rocks,
where kids would joy to disport, but where he
shook with fear. However, riding was less
trouble than walking on such a road; and I got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
safely through. We passed another tope which
had been opened, and a succession of forts; and
at length arrived at Noor Mahommed, the Meer
Akor's Fort: here we were not expected; no
notice having been given. The truth is, that the
Sirdar ordered us to be sent to a fort of Mahommed
Shah Khan's, two miles from this one; but
Mahommed is to bring his family hither; and
was determined to keep his own fort for them.
We were first told that two open stables or cow-sheds,
down a narrow gulley in the outer square,
were all the accommodation they had to give us.</p>

<p>As no one would fight for the ladies, I determined
to <i>be Yaghi</i> myself; and I went with Mr.
Melville to Dost Mahommed Khan and Mahommed
Rufeek. At length our bower party
got a small room over the gateway of the inner
fort; with a promise of better quarters for all
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The reason given for our sudden flitting from
Zanduh is an expected chupao from the two
chiefs, Azaid Khan, and Aziz Khan; who offered,
if Macgregor would furnish the cash, to raise 2000
men, and carry us off to our friends.</p>

<p>There was firing of guns all day long; and at
night very sharp firing, without much intermission.
Being in pain from the arm that was wounded,
and in great anxiety for the result (having heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
from the Affghans here that Akbar meant to
surprise and take the Bala Hissar), I never
closed my eyes until after daybreak; when we
heard the muezzin call to prayers.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;The tables were turned last night; for a
sally was made from the Bala Hissar; and Mahommed
Akbar Khan was, they say, nearly caught.
He escaped to a fort near the Shah's camp, behind
Siah Sung.</p>

<p>The females were removed from this fort,
and we all got excellent quarters. In addition
to the two rooms apportioned to our party, we
have permission to sit, in the daytime, in a room
in a bourj, a small octagon with oorsees or open-work
lattices. There are two flights of steep
steps to mount to it from our apartments, which
are upstairs; but the view from it is so refreshing,
looking over all the forts and highly cultivated
grounds; it has the advantage of being
always cool; and which compensates for the trouble
in getting there.</p>

<p>The Sirdar says he will not remain here when
our force comes up, but retire to the Kohistan,
and allow the English to take Cabul: after which
he will come forward with an offer to go to
Hindostan, and take his father's place, if they
will permit the Ameer Dost Mahommed Khan to
return and rule in this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
<i>26th.</i>&mdash;We heard a few guns early in the
morning. This day they say the Sirdar is to have
a friendly conference with Futteh Jung; but it is
to be hoped that the latter will not put himself into
the power of his treacherous enemy.</p>

<p>Khan Shireen Khan, the head of the Kuzzilbashes,
keeps neuter. Zeman Shah Khan seems
to be but a lukewarm friend of the Sirdar.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of Cabul are all disgusted at the
treachery that took place, ending in the murder
of Shah Shoojah.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers and merchants wish for us
back; as the circulation of rupees is much less
than in our time: and the cultivators would fain
leave the army and look after their crops.</p>

<p>Gen. Pollock offers to exchange the captive
ladies and children, against Akbar's family of four
wives with their children. One of the former is a
daughter of Mahommed Shah Khan; and another
is a sister of Sirballan Khan's. Capt. Troup
came to see us, and brought us a message from
the Sirdar, desiring we would all write to him,
and state whatever we required, that he might
send it to us.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Capt. Troup returned to the Sirdar,
and took our notes and lists with him; also a
letter for Sale, though he doubts its being sent
immediately. This day was fixed for a conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
between Akbar and Futteh Jung: Akbar
required him to vacate the Bala Hissar; and
says he may go into the strongest fort in the
neighbourhood, and keep all his guns; giving up
his army, wherewith Akbar is to go down and
fight the British force. No firing heard to-day;
but we hope that Futteh Jung will manage
to hold out until our force comes to his
assistance.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;The advance of our army has arrived at
Gundamuk; and the rest are following, purchasing
up carriage at any expense.</p>

<p>The Kandahar force have been attacked by
the Affghans; who have been signally defeated;
which has struck such terror into them, that
they are flying in all directions: this is their
own account.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Sujat Dowlut, the son of Zeman Shah
Khan, and the murderer of Shah Shoojah, came to
the fort to visit Ali Mohammed Khan. To his
father's honour be it said that he refused to see
him for some time after the murder. It is
reported that we leave this place in six days for&mdash;no
one knows where.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;There was firing late in the evening from
the Bala Hissar and the city. A man of some
respectability, with three or four followers, came
to see Capt. Johnson, and bring him some things:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
they were all taken away by the Affghans; and
the people carried off prisoners to Akbar.</p>

<p>The Kuzzilbashes have openly declared in
favour of Futteh Jung. They are throwing provisions
into the Bala Hissar; and strengthening
the works.</p>

<p>Our troops have been some days at Gundamuk.
There are orders that the officers are
not to go out of the fort, as they did before, to
bathe. We hope we shall not be interdicted
walking in the garden, as we always have guards
with us there; and every night we are locked into
the square; and the servants cannot go outside
the gate for any purpose without a guard.</p>

<p><i>1st June.</i>&mdash;The Naïb Shureef is obliged to
hide for safety. Mahommed Rufeek is sent
away; and Ali Mohammed Khan has now sole
charge of us.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;It is true that our troops left Kandahar
on the 16th of last month. General Nott's force
has given the Affghans a fourth beating at
Khelat-i-Gilzie; and killed 2000 men. Gen.
Pollock's division is expected here on the 15th.</p>

<p>Sharp firing all day; particularly in the afternoon,
evening, and all night.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;The servants have a report that whenever
we leave this place, Futteh Jung means to
chupao us; and that twenty men are always on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
watch, mounted, to carry the intelligence of our
removal to him.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Capt. Troup came to us; and brought
me two parcels from Sale; one of which was for
distribution amongst the ladies. Also letters
enclosing copies of Lord Ellenborough's and Sir
Jasper Nicholls' letters to him. Their contents
were so gratifying that I shook off all my feverish
feelings and concomitant weakness; and in the
gladness of my heart felt quite well again.</p>

<p>Troup seems to think that the Sirdar will
succeed in getting possession of the Bala Hissar.
He assures Futteh Jung that he has a mine all
ready to spring; but will not have recourse to it
till the last moment. Now this is an evident
<i>ruse</i>; for if he had the means he would take the
Bala Hissar at once: and we have heard that he
has mined in three places to the extent of twelve
hauts; but has each time come to solid rock, on
which the miners can make no impression. The
cossid, who brought our letters, brought one also
for the Sirdar; and another for Futteh Jung from
Macgregor: on the receipt of the latter, Futteh
Jung fired a royal salute and made a sally.</p>

<p>The Sirdar sent us some coarse cloth, soap, an
Affghan chillumchee, and some tallow candles:
others received sundry donations of the like
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
<i>6th.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar is said to have possession of
the Bala Hissar; and to occupy the gate nearest
to us: while the Kuzzilbashes hold the Chandowlee
gate; and Mahommed Shah another.
Futteh Jung is said to have given up two lakhs
of rupees to Akbar.</p>

<p>The tale of the mine was true; but Futteh Jung
had filled it with water.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shah Khan and Sultan Jan have
been daily for three days at the Bala Hissar, unattended;
in conference with the Shah-zada, who
gave them khelluts, &amp;c . He then asked Mahommed
Akbar Khan to meet him in friendly conference
in the gateway, each to have only five
followers: but the Sirdar refused to go further
than John Hicks' tomb, fearing treachery. He had
previously warned Mahommed Shah not to trust
Futteh Jung; who might easily have secured the
two others each of these days: but we suspect his
aim was to lull them into security, to enable
him to seize the Sirdar.</p>

<p>Here he has shown bad policy: for though
Akbar is the superior in rank, Mahommed Shah
has the troops, and what money they can raise
at command. Sultan Jan is the fighting arm of
the trio, under the latter; whilst Akbar sits in
durbar, laughs, talks, and squeezes all who are
suspected of having money. He has carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
kept all our notes to him, asking for or thanking
him for things received: no doubt to produce
at the last; as a further proof of his kindness to
his captives. Dr. Grant is said to be alive and
safe with some Bunneah; who of course keeps him
secreted from the chiefs, that he and not they may
have a reward: but we heard so positively that he
was killed, near the lake beyond Behmaru, that
our hopes are but faint.</p>

<p>Much firing in the evening and night.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;We hear that last night there was a
sortie from the Bala Hissar; and an attack made
on two guns of Mahommed Akbar's. They did not
succeed in capturing them; but took some ammunition
and camels. An attempt was made to
carry off the camels belonging to this fort, which
were out grazing; but six horsemen went from
hence and rescued them.</p>

<p>Akbar says he does not spring his mine because
it will damage the walls of the Bala Hissar,
and make it easier for the English to enter the
place; and that even were the gates open, he
doubts the courage of his troops to enter them.</p>

<p>Amenoollah Khan has been for some time soliciting
permission to leave the Sirdar, to go to
Loghur on important affairs of his own: this has
induced the Sirdar to seize him, which is now
supposed to be the cause of all the firing we heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
last night. Whether this will prove for our advantage
or not, remains to be proved.</p>

<p>This chief is said to have eighteen lakhs of
rupees; which Mahommed Akbar Khan will probably
endeavour to squeeze out of him: however,
he is not likely to have it here. If his treasure is
secure at Loghur, and his sons rise in his favour
(as he can bring 10,000 men into the field), a
very powerful diversion may be formed, whether
they join us or Futteh Jung: if, on the contrary,
Akbar procures even one lakh of ready cash, he
can do much mischief; by raising troops even for
a few weeks to annoy our force. The celerity
with which troops are raised is quite astonishing
to us; who are accustomed to see recruits drilled
for a length of time. Here, every man is born a
soldier; every child has his knife,&mdash;that weapon
which has proved so destructive in the hands of a
hostile peasantry, incited against us by the moollahs,
who threaten eternal perdition to all who
do not join in the cause of the Ghazeeas; whilst
heaven, filled with Houris, is the recompence
for every man who falls in a religious war. With
them, the only expense attending the soldier consists
in his pay, which is scanty; his horse, if
he have one, is his own; and every Affghan
is armed completely with some three or four of
these knives, of different sizes&mdash;from that as long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
as a sword to a small dagger&mdash;pistols, and a
juzail; which latter predominates over the matchlock:
they carry much farther than our muskets;
so that when our men are beyond range to hit
them, they pour a destroying fire on us. Regarding
these same muskets being better than
matchlocks; those who had only the latter may
have taken them of late in exchange; but, generally
speaking, the only useful part to the
Affghans are the locks; which they tear off, and
leave the rest.</p>

<p>Capt. Troup did not return to the Sirdar till
this morning. The man, who went with him, has
returned; and states that the Sirdar has blown up
the bastion of the Bala Hissar which is nearest to
the Sh&#333;r Bazar. There is, however, some discrepancy
in his account; as he states that he saw
the Sirdar's men parading about on the tops of
the very bastion that has been destroyed: he also
added, that they were busily employed in throwing
out the dead bodies.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that Gen. Pollock's force
does not move up. Futteh Jung pays the Hindostanees
in the Bala Hissar a rupee a day to
keep watch at the gates; being afraid to trust
the Affghans.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar's guns are worked by three
Chuprassies, two Buglers, and a few other of our
runaways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
It is said that whenever we leave this place,
there will be great opposition made to our removal;
and that various parties will endeavour to
get us into their power.</p>

<p>3 <small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Further accounts have just been
brought in; stating that yesterday's fight, at the
Bala Hissar, was commenced by Sultan Jan.
When he got tired, Mahommed Shah Khan took
his place; and when he too was fatigued, the
Sirdar assumed command in person. When he
brought his gun to bear on the mine at the
bourj, Futteh Jung ran another gun opposite;
and blew the Sirdar's gun away!&mdash;a novel method
of firing a train; nevertheless it seems the mine
was fired; and, by some bungling, Akbar blew up
300 of his own men. But Futteh Jung gave in,
and the Sirdar is supposed to have the Bala
Hissar. We only obtain such information as the
Khan and his guard are pleased to communicate;
excepting those of our party who perchance overhear
them speaking amongst themselves; when,
however, they generally use Pushtoo, to prevent
our understanding them. Four Coolies have
arrived with two tin boxes and two baskets from
Tézeen. They are supposed to have come from
Jellalabad; as all were quickly huddled into a
room and locked up; and a man despatched to the
Sirdar to know his pleasure concerning them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
The packets have been distributed; mostly medicine
for Dr. Magrath.</p>

<p>There were letters and newspapers; but those
have been sent to the Sirdar.</p>

<p>In the garden in the evening we heard that the
Sirdar had sent his salaam, that he was master of
the Bala Hissar: but just as we entered the gate
we heard that, so far from that being the case,
he had only taken the bourj above. Now that
same bourj above completely commands the fort.
However Akbar has no guns in it; though by
manual labour he could easily drag them up.
The mountain train guns go up on mules well;
and I have seen them myself practising over that
very hill.</p>

<p>There is another report that Gool Mahommed
is to chupao us in four days. We heard the
report of some juzails between nine and ten
<small>P.M.</small></p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;The servants declare, that above forty
guns were fired last night between eleven and
twelve; but some of the officers, who were
awake, did not hear them any more than I did.
On the same authority we have a rumour of
Futteh Jung's having taken two of the Sirdar's
tents and some ammunition; and of his having
killed forty of his Ghazeeas.</p>

<p>They say that the Sirdar sent Zernan Shah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
Khan to treat with Futteh Jung; and to propose
that the latter should remain king; making
Akbar his wuzeer; and that he should make
over all the guns and troops to him, to go and
fight the English with. Futteh Jung has placed
Zeman Shah Khan in confinement, until he gets
a reply to his message to the Sirdar, in which he
accedes to his request; on condition that he previously
places all the captives in his hands.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Capt. Mackenzie arrived; and brought
some newspapers and letters,&mdash;those which we
have been expecting back from the Sirdar: and
we strongly suspect that he has kept many.
Mackenzie assures us that Futteh Jung has
surrendered the Bala Hissar to Akbar Khan;
who has demanded all his treasure, as the first
step he takes.</p>

<p>There seems to have been no military necessity
for the surrender. One bourj had been mined;
but traverses might have been thrown up to
render the place perfectly secure from any
Affghan attack. It is probable that the Arabs
were intimidated by the effect of the mine; <i>that</i>
being a species of warfare they particularly dread.
Futteh Jung had held out for a month&mdash;the
time, it is said, he had promised to do so; and
Pollock's force not moving to his succour, he
probably became disheartened. He now has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
only lost his treasure; but it is likely he may
lose his life also: for he never can feel safe whilst
in the power of Akbar and Mahommed Shah.
The latter resides in the Bala Hissar; the former
in the Sh&#333;r Bazar. Both Mahommed Shah and
Sultan Jan were wounded in the explosion of the
bourj, by stones falling on their heads.</p>

<p>Pollock's force is suffering from sickness; occasioned
by the great heat of Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Col. Parsons' arrangements only extend to
camels and carriage cattle as far as Peshawer.
Capt. Mackeson, with great difficulty, prevailed on
them to go as far as Jellalabad; but no further:
and immense exertions have been made to enable
the force to leave that place. The arrangements
are, we hear, nearly completed: but now that
Akbar has money (18 lakhs, it is said) at his command,
he may raise troops to harass ours.</p>

<p>Gen. Nott is said still to be encamped on this
side of Khelat-i-Gilzie. A week or ten days ago,
one brigade might have taken Cabul without
opposition.</p>

<p>The Affghans are very jealous of any people
coming to us; lest we should obtain information.
A young man of great respectability, who came to
bring some things for Capt. Johnson a few days
since, has been fined 6000 rupees; and in addition
to that has been tortured, and had all his nails
torn out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
<i>10th.</i>&mdash;A slight earthquake in the morning; and
four shocks during the night.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Our guard is increased by thirty men.</p>

<p>The fruit in the garden is sold to a Khoord;
who says, if we will pay him a few rupees, we
may eat any we like: but the grapes are sour,
and will not be ripe for these six weeks at
least. The sour plums make preserves.</p>

<p>It appears very uncertain what power Akbar
really possesses. The Kuzzilbashes occupy the
gate which commands their quarter. Mahommed
Shah Khan has one. Futteh Jung is still king,
and lives in the interior of the Bala Hissar.
Akbar still inhabits a house in the Sh&#333;r Bazar.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;A Hindostanee was severely beaten at
the gate; being suspected of bringing in news.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;A Peshawer-i-Suwar was beaten, and
had his horse taken from him, for attempting to
come here: if he had any letters, they were not
discovered.</p>

<p>Various reports to-day: some, that our troops
are at Gundamuk; and others that the forces both
at Jellalabad and at Kandahar, &amp;c . are all retreating
to the provinces, and leaving us to enjoy the
gentle mercies of our captors.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Ali Mahommed Khan says that we shall
not leave this fort: that even if Akbar meditated
our removal, the various tribes, by whom we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
surrounded, would look to their own interests; and
interfere to get us into their own hands. This
agrees with what Dost Mahommed Khan told us
at Zanduh; that the Sirdar had been peremptory
in ordering our removal to Cabul; but that he had,
in so doing, committed a great mistake; as he
would probably find out in three or four days
after our arrival at the capital; and when it would
be too late to rectify his error.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;In consequence of having yesterday
given a rupee to the Khoordish Baghwan, he had
this evening two dallies of the finest mulberries
the garden produced (the Bédanas) ready for us:
nicely cooled by the rill of the stream, and
covered with a shower of roses. We filled our
basket; and sat and ate the fruit under the vines;
and look forward to delicious sherbet from the
flowers to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;Towards morning we were awakened by
such a noise, that we could not possibly imagine
it to be less than a chupao: on inquiry it proved
to be a row between an ayah and a bearer.</p>

<p>The <i>on-dit</i> of to-day is, that 4000 Sikhs are to
hold Jellalabad, whilst our troops come up to
Cabul. The Affghans say that eight of our regiments
are at Gundamuk. On the arrival of the force it
is expected by the Affghans that Akbar and
Mahommed Shah will flee; but that very few of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
their followers will accompany them. They will
take us with them; either to Mecca or Room!
By the latter they mean Constantinople.</p>

<p>They tell us that Futteh Jung is a prisoner.</p>

<p>Late in the evening news arrived that Kamran
(who, by-the-bye, we heard was put to death by
his minister, Yai Mahommed, some time since) is
coming with an army from Herat; to form a coalition
with Futteh Jung, Akbar, the Ghilzyes,
and all the Affghan chiefs. They are to go down
and fight our force: if they are successful, we are
to remain as we are; if not, to be sent viâ Charekar
to Turkistan.</p>

<p>A report prevalent amongst the Affghans that
our force has marched from Jellalabad; and that
we consequently shall soon be removed from
hence.</p>

<p>The Prince Futteh Jung is still in confinement.
Mahommed Akbar Khan, Mahommed Shah Khan,
and the Ghilzye chiefs, are bent on having him
put to death. Zeman Shah Khan, and the more
moderate party, oppose it: not from affection for
us or him, but as a measure of better policy. The
Ghazeeas, however, are determined to steep the
chiefs as deeply in blood as they can, to prevent
the possibility of their making any terms with
us. They say the captives shall not be taken
away from Cabul; and that if the Sirdar or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
of the Ghilzye chiefs attempt to fly, they will
put them to death.</p>

<p>Zeman Khan wishes the Sirdar to send him to
Jellalabad to treat; taking the captives with him.
This Akbar will not hear of: and they have had a
quarrel, ending in a fight. The sound of cannon
has been heard; also vollies of musketry. A
grand battle is to come off on Sunday.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Waterloo day.&mdash;It seems that we are
to be sent viâ the Kohistan to Bokhara. Mackenzie
writes, that we are to be prepared for a
sudden move.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;A letter is said to have arrived from
Gen. Pollock to Akbar; who, with Futteh Jung
and all the chiefs, is going in four days to
Jellalabad to salaam. The Ameer is on his way
up to resume the throne.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Henry's birthday; celebrated by a
great battle in Cabul; in which Akbar has
been victorious; though he has lost from sixty
to eighty men.</p>

<p>Zeman Shah Khan is said to have been made
prisoner, with both his sons.</p>

<p>Another report states, they have all three escaped:
also, that Zeman was surrounded in a fort,
but contrived to get away from it. He had
eighteen guns out; and the Sirdar had as many:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
the latter is going down to Jellalabad, to give
battle to the English force there.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;Various reports to-day:&mdash;That Zeman
Khan lost fifteen guns yesterday, and all his
treasure:&mdash;that to-morrow there will be a great
fight between the Sirdar and Khan Shireen
Khan.</p>

<p>Later accounts in the evening state that Khan
Shireen has made his salaam; and that we are to
go to the Bala Hissar. Plenty of firing heard
by us: said by some to be fighting; by others
to be salutes in honour of Futteh Jung being
<i>declared</i> king.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;The Dost is not to come up until after
the rains. No chance of our removal at present.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;Mackenzie and Troup arrived.</p>

<p>Colonel Palmer is said to have been tortured
at Ghuznee. Mohun Lull has been seized, and
tortured. Humza Khan has been imprisoned by
the Sirdar. Ali Bega, Naïb Shureef, and Jan
Fishan Khan have fled: the latter's two sons have
been murdered. Osman Khan (the late wuzeer)
has been seized by Akbar. Nott is said to have
returned to Kandahar; after putting to death all
his Affghan captives, and blowing up Kelat-i-Ghilzie.
This seems (if true) to be a strange
proceeding, if we are to retain the country; as the
fortress was but just completed; and was considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
an indispensable site for a granary and
depôt of troops. Major Rawlinson's opinion is,
that our troops will all be withdrawn in the
autumn: but this does not square with the order,
received by Ali Bega from Dallas, to lay in all
the provisions he can possibly store in Cabul.</p>

<p>Ali Mahommed tells us that the Khyberries
have risen; and that we have sent two regiments
and two guns against them: but there is an inkling
that more guns have arrived at Jellalabad;
and therefore we might have sent a force to protect
them on their way up. They say, also, that
Pollock has actually moved up as far as Gundamuk;
and there is a report that our men at Buddeeabad
have been set at liberty by our troops;
who blew up the fort, and also that at Tighree.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;A report that 10,000 Sikhs have come
up from Peshawer; that they are in the Lughman
valley; have destroyed Tighree; and, fearing
a chupao on Buddeeabad, all the prisoners there
were brought away: they were fed on bread and
water only after we left them. The day after our
departure, Mrs. Wade (wife of a sergeant) changed
her attire, threw off the European dress, and
adopted the costume of the Mussulmans; and, professing
to have changed her creed also, consorted
with the Nazir of our inveterate enemy, Mahommed
Shah Khan; and gave information of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
plans laid by the men for their escape; which
nearly caused them all to have their throats cut.
Having reported to her Affghan paramour the
manner in which her husband had secreted some
gold mohurs in his jorabs, he was of course plundered
of them. The Hindostanees were stripped
of every article of clothing they possessed; and
had even the rags taken off their sores, to ascertain
there was no money concealed: they were
then turned out. Some got to Jellalabad;
through the kindness of a Hindu Bunneah, who
sent them down on a jhala; others have been
made slaves. Of the unfortunate servants, Mrs.
Sturt and I left behind us, we have no tidings.</p>

<p>The Europeans found it dreadfully hot at Buddeeabad;
and most of them were attacked by fever:
their only remedy being bleeding with a penknife;
in which Mr. Blewitt was very successful.
One man (Sergt. Reynolds), who was left there
with a broken arm, died of lockjaw.</p>

<p>Sergt. Fare brought with him the colour of the
44th which has been before mentioned. A few
days after Capt. Souter's arrival at Buddeeabad,
Brig. Shelton expressed a wish that the colour
should be given to his servant. (Moore, of the
44th); for the purpose of sewing it in a piece of
cloth; and to keep it in his possession. Previous
to our quitting Buddeeabad, the Brigadier suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
that the colour should be left with Sergt.
Fare; who, with the party that was left at the
fort, would, it was expected, be released before
those who proceeded to Cabul. Sergt. Fare
kept the colour concealed by wrapping it round
him; and when he joined us here (at Shewakee)
he made it over to Gen. Shelton; who retains it
in his possession.</p>

<p>Of so incorrect a personage as Mrs. Wade I
shall only further say, that she is at Mahommed
Shah Khan's fort with her Affghan lover; and has
taken with her young Stoker. As he is the son
of a man in Sale's regiment, I am doing all I can
to get the Sirdar (through Capt. Troup's entreaty)
to have him brought here; and again
placed under Mrs. Burnes's care. She and her
infant are looking very miserable, as are most of
the men.</p>

<p>Col. Stoddart and Capt. Arthur Conolly are
prisoners at Bokhara. The latter had been enthusiastically
employed in endeavouring to effect the
release of the slaves in Kokan. The king of
Bokhara conquered the chief of that country; and
placed Conolly in confinement at Bokhara. He
and his fellow-prisoner, by the last accounts, had
been 126 days confined in a dungeon underground,
without light: they had never changed their
clothes, nor washed; and their food was let down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
to them once in four or five days. A native, who
had compassion on them, received a message
through the person who took their food to them;
and through him Conolly has communicated with
his family here; who, alas! are now powerless to
assist him.</p>

<p>We ate the first really ripe apricots (<i>zerdaloos</i>)
and cherries (<i>gulas</i>) brought in from the city: but
the produce of the Kohistan, the aloo baloo, or
sour wild cherry, in the garden, is now pretty
ripe; and the apricots and some of the green plums
are ripening. The peach of this garden is very inferior
to what I used to purchase last year. The
best apricot in it is the white one; it is called
kysee; and has a flavour of rose-water.</p>

<p>The red plum is not permitted to ripen properly:
it has some flavour; and is called turnasook.
The green plum looks something like a
greengage; but has no flavour except that of <i>eau
sucrée</i>.</p>

<p>It is said, on the authority of Sergt. Wade,&mdash;who
was informed by his wife, who professed to have
her information from Mahommed Shah Khan's
family,&mdash;that we are all going to be sent to Bokhara.
There is also a report, not however traceable
to any foundation, that Pollock's force is not
to move upwards until the middle of August.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;An earthquake about 11 <small>A.M.</small>, and another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
about 9 <small>P.M.</small>; sufficient both times to make
the roof creak.</p>

<p>We have heard from undoubted authority that
Mahommed Akbar Khan said in the durbar, before
he left Cabul to follow our troops in January,
that it was his intention to go and <i>kuttle kurra</i>,
or cut the throats of all our force; <i>and, after that,
let</i> <small>THEM</small> <i>beware</i>,&mdash;meaning the chiefs. He seems
to be now verifying his promise; and is, by all accounts,
squeezing as much wealth as he can out
of all those who are in his power; and disgusting
every one of them.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Jan Fishan Khan has escaped to Jellalabad.
Khan Shireen Khan, and many of those
friendly to the English, have retired into the
hills.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Troup left us; taking part of my journal,
and plenty of letters; as it is said he is to be sent
to Jellalabad. Mackenzie is ill with fever; and
unable to go with him.</p>

<p><i>July 1st.</i>&mdash;The Sirdar has promised that Stoker
shall be sent back to us; but he has not yet
arrived.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Troup arrived; and brought us a comb and
two caps from Mahommed Rufeek. The Sirdar
still talks of sending him to Jellalabad; but says
he must wait four or five days, as he, the Sirdar,
is busy collecting his revenue. The hostages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
are all coming here to-morrow or next day. I
fear their arrival will crowd us very much; and at
present we have Mackenzie, Waller, and Melville
laid up with fever.</p>

<p>Timor Shah says that if the English will support
him on his father's throne, well and good; if
not, that he will prefer going to Loodianah, on a
pension.</p>

<p>A man has just come in, and reports that our
troops are in the Lughman valley. We conclude
they are foraging parties, collecting grain.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;The Cabullees say they will cut Akbar
in pieces, before they will permit us to be taken
away. The hostages are sold to Akbar for 400
gold mohurs.</p>

<p>Sultan Khan, said to be made Sirdar-i-Sirdaran.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;The Wuzeer Akbar Khan went to reside
in the Bala Hissar. Troup, who left us, had to
follow him there with Pottinger.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;All the hostages are to come here; except
Conolly, who is to remain with the Wuzeer
in the Bala Hissar. There are reports that our
troops have left Kandahar; having received a
number of camels from Sindh. When the cossid
started, they had made three marches hither-wards.
As a cossid takes eight or ten days to
come, they must have left Kandahar about the
26th or 28th. They have twenty-two marches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
thence to Cabul; which, with the detention at
Ghuznee, and on the road, if they have any fighting,
will retard the arrival of the force until from
the 25th instant to the 1st of August.</p>

<p>Akbar has ordered the ditch round the Bala
Hissar to be cleaned out; and proposes sending
6000 men, under Mahommed Shah Khan, to occupy
the passes between this place and Jellalabad.
But his grand battle is to take place here, on the
plain in front of the Bala Hissar. Akbar has
ordered every one to be fined who addresses him,
or speaks of him, otherwise than as the wuzeer.
Mrs. Burnes' child died; and was buried under the
hill: the service was performed by Mr. Eyre.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;The news we heard yesterday is confirmed
by Troup and Conolly; with this addition from
the Khan, that Timor Shah is proclaimed King of
Kandahar. Col. Palmer is said to have died at
Ghuznee. When Mahommed Akbar Khan went
to the durbar the day we left Cabul, prepared for
his journey, and publicly declared that it was his
intention to <i>kuttle kurra</i> all the English, Zeman
Shah Khan sent to Conolly, who wrote off to
Major Pottinger, to put him on his guard. This
letter arrived at Bhoodkhak while Pottinger and
Akbar were in conference: the treating went on
notwithstanding, and the result was the hostages
being given. At this time, the people at Cabul all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
supposed that, as Akbar had only about 300 men
with him, we should make him prisoner.</p>

<p>When Shah Shoojah was killed, a letter was
found on him from Capt. Macgregor, dated in
April; telling him to hold out fifteen days longer,
and he should have assistance.</p>

<p>The Nawaub Zeman Shah Khan has spent two
lakhs in raising men on our side; and in feeding
troops to act against Akbar. He has still
1000 men; but now wants money. He also fed
hundreds of wretched Hindostanees, who were
starving in Cabul; great numbers of whom were
seized, sold for one and two rupees each, and
sent to Turkistan. Zeman Shah Khan did every
thing in his power to put a stop to this.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Mishdeen, in the Ahmedzye country,
S.E. of Tezeen, belongs to Sultan Khan. This is
the place we are likely to go to, if we are removed
from hence. When little Tootsey (Capt. Anderson's
child) was carried off in the Khoord Cabul pass,
she was taken direct to Cabul: and the Khan rode
up and down the streets with her; offering her for
sale for 4000 rupees. After some negotiation
regarding the price, Conolly purchased the child;
who was in the hands of Amenoollah Khan. A
plot was laid to take Conolly's life, and that of the
other hostages; but Taj Mahommed Khan gave
them timely warning not to attend the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
should they be sent for. The restoration of the
child was a good pretext: and Amenoollah tried
to persuade them to go and thank the king for his
kindness; when, as soon as they reached the door,
they were to have been assassinated. They made
some excuse of ill health; and escaped. Nothing
could exceed the kindness of Zeman Shah Khan,
both to the hostages and the little girl; who
became much attached to her new friends. Taj
Mahommed Khan, Khan Shireen Khan, the Naïb
Shureef, and many others, did all they could,
consistently with the safety of both parties, to
make them comfortable.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Two men have come in; who repeat the
old story of ten days since;&mdash;that there has
been a great battle at Peshbolak; where every
man, woman, and child was killed; that at Ali
Baghan the men were all killed, but the women
and children spared; and that the slaughter of the
Affghans has been great. By the account of
another cossid, who came in yesterday in twelve
days from Kandahar, Nott's force ought to-day to
be at Mookkoor.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;The Wuzeer is to be married to one of
Amenoollah Khan's daughters.</p>

<p>Our fever cases to-day consist of Mackenzie,
Waller, Freddy Eyre, Mrs. Waller, Magrath, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
ayahs, one or two Hindostanee servants, and
several soldiers.</p>

<p>An earthquake at night.</p>

<p>Major Pottinger arrived. Troup went to Jellalabad
the night before last. There is a report
that we are building a fort at Jugdaluk: also
that 70,000 men are collecting at Ferozepore;
25,000 of these are to form a corps of observation
there; 15,000 are now at Kandahar; and 20,000
at Jellalabad; and 10,000 are coming from England.
These are independent of Gen. Brookes's
force in Sindh.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;The Wuzeer had all the kujavas ready to
move us in two days; but the Cabullees would not
let him.</p>

<p>Yai Mahommed, who is supreme at Kandahar,
having, it is said, Shah Kamran in <i>kyde</i>, has invited
Akbar to go to him at Herat: but he, good
man, has other views; such as friendship and alliance
with the Feringhees. He <i>only</i> asks to be
acknowledged King of Affghanistan; and to have a
subsidiary force with which to conquer Bokhara.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Shumshudeen Khan refuses to give up
the Ghuznee prisoners. Only Lumsden and his
wife are killed. Col. Palmer is said to have died
of a fever; but whether brought on by the torture
said to have been inflicted on him, or not, is not
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
Four of our regiments are at Gundamuk; erecting
a fort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevor gave birth to another girl, to add
to the list of captives.</p>

<p>Two earthquakes to-day.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;Mr. Campbell, assistant surgeon of the
54th, who was left at Cabul with the sick of the
various regiments, came here a few days since to
consult regarding Capt. Mackenzie's case. It is
now decided that he remains here; as the men
at Cabul are very healthy, and we have got what
seems very like a gaol fever amongst us.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;Conolly and Airey came to pay us a
visit. A letter has been received by the former
from Gen. Pollock; who offers to exchange all the
Affghan prisoners in Hindostan against the captives
that are in this country. He writes, that if
Conolly thinks his going to Jellalabad will facilitate
arrangements, he is to go thither, accompanied
by all those who appear to have been foremost
in civility to us,&mdash;Khan Shireen Khan, Mahommed
Shah Khan, &amp;c . (How our friends and
enemies are here mixed up; for the latter chief is
our most inveterate foe!) He tells him also of the
force now in the country, and of that expected
from Hindostan and England; the army of observation
to be commanded by Sir Jasper Nicholls: and
states that if we are driven to extremities against
the Affghans, their punishment will be fearful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
Also, that if Akbar wishes to make friends with
us, he ought to give up all our guns. As far
as I can understand, the captives on both sides are
to be placed in the hands of the Sikhs.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;The Wuzeer, Mahommed Akbar Khan,
and the Sirdar-i-Sirdaran, Sultan Jan, Mahommed
Shah Khan, &amp;c ., paid a visit here; and sat in the
garden, which was quickly despoiled of all the
fruits: no doubt greatly to the Khoord's disgust;
although some small sum was given to him as a
recompence.</p>

<p>We received letters and papers from Jellalabad
which must have been lying with Akbar for above
a month.</p>

<p>Lady Macnaghten has had a part of her jewels
restored to her; but in a sadly broken condition.
They <i>talk</i> of giving back the rest.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;Half rations issued to us, and no meat.
This is to repay Ali Mahommed for the expense of
feasting the great people yesterday, I suppose:
though he saved all the expense he could; sending
to one person for tea, to another for sugar; and
saying it was for the Wuzeer, who sent his salaam
for it. I believe Akbar pays high prices that he
may have plenty of the best of every thing; and is
of course cheated by his purveyors: but he would
never send to us to supply his wants.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Ali Mahommed Khan reports that 1000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
men are gone to defend the passes: he also hints
that we shall be released soon.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;Dost Mahommed Khan came. He says
we shall be kalôss in twenty days; that there is
to be an exchange of prisoners; and that the guns
are to be given up.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;Commemoration of the capture of Ghuznee;
over which, in its recaptured state, we groan
in spirit. An earthquake at night.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;At two <small>P.M.</small> Mrs. Sturt presented me
with a grand-daughter;&mdash;another female captive.
Capt. Troup and Hadje Bukhtian are accepted
by Pollock; who will have nothing to do with
Major Pottinger. It seems all the Politicals are
set aside. The terms are, that Akbar gives up
the guns and all British subjects attached to the
camp, in exchange for the ex-Ameer and all the
Affghan prisoners. A truce agreed to for a
month: the agents to remain at Jellalabad, until
Gen. Pollock hears from Lord Ellenborough
whether he will enter into an alliance.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;They now require that all Shah Shoojah's
family be given up to Akbar; to be dealt
with as best pleases him and Mahommed Shah
Khan. A report that our force is coming up.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Troup arrived from Jellalabad. Akbar
has deceived us: there is no armistice; no collection
of revenue by him where our troops are.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
On the contrary, we have taken supplies to the
extent of six months' provisions, without payment,
in the neighbourhood of Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Nothing had been decided on which tends towards
our release.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Troup, who purchased a quantity of
things of all kinds for us at Jellalabad, <i>opened his
shop</i>; and I procured arrow root, cotton gloves,
reels of cotton, tape, soap, jalap, and cream of
tartar.</p>

<p>Troup left us in the evening, and went to the
Wuzeer. He expects to be sent to Jellalabad;
and I gave him more of my Journal, to take to
Sale.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;At two this morning Troup and Lawrence
left us for Jellalabad. We hear that orders
have been sent to the Kandahar force to move up;
and that there has been some fighting, and a
great many Affghans killed. On inquiry being
made, the Affghans told the following tale:&mdash;That
one regiment was out beyond Lughman,
foraging; that in the night the people rose, and
our troops retired; on which we sent 12,000
men! with a park of artillery! against which, of
course, the Affghans could not stand. There
has been probably some trifling skirmish. The
Kandahar troops are ordered up; and the
Wuzeer told Lawrence (who says he never saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">{388}</a></span>
him appear so angry before) that if our troops
advance, he should take us all to Bameean, and
make a present of us to the chiefs of that place:
so that our prospects appear gloomier than ever.
I cannot understand the motive of moving up the
troops both ways. Nott is to go to Ghuznee to
receive the prisoners: not to fight, but only to
defend himself if attacked; and then to come here
and join Pollock: and, having received us, all are
to walk back hand in hand. We are not to
attack Cabul, &amp;c ., but to evacuate the country;
with Akbar, the Ghilzyes, the Barukzyes, and all
the other <i>Zyes</i> hanging on our flanks and rear: and
if they can but get us to procrastinate, so as to give
them the advantage of their faithful ally <i>the
snow</i>, the Affghans will have the satisfaction of
destroying another and still larger army this year.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;Had Skinner lived, he would have
thrown more light than any other person upon
the late events; as he was the bearer of the
messages, more especially of the one sent on
the night before the Envoy's death. It is
as nearly certain as such an event can be, that
poor Skinner, who was evidently a dupe to Akbar
Khan, was put to death by his orders. At Jugdaluk,
after the General, the Brigadier, and Johnson
were in the Sirdar's power, Major Thain went to the
other officers and said, "I fear there is treachery:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
poor Skinner has been shot; and had the object of
the Affghan only been to kill a Feringhee, he would
not have passed <i>me</i> to shoot <i>him</i>." There can be
little doubt, that the Sirdar was anxious to put out
of the way one who could give such fearful evidence
against him. Trevor was also much in the
Envoy's confidence; and he also became a victim.
I have, however, heard that Skinner was not in
reality the dupe he appeared to be: and that he
had expressed to the Envoy his conviction that
the Sirdar was not trustworthy. Yet, if so, it is
strange he should have placed the faith he did in
him during the retreat; and have advised our
going over to him;&mdash;unless indeed he saw further
into Akbar's policy than others; and believed that
we should be treated with honour and kept by
him as a <i>dernier ressort</i>. What will now be our
fate seems very uncertain: but I still think he
will not cut our throats;&mdash;not out of love to us,
but because the other chiefs would resent it; as,
having possession of us, they could at least obtain
a handsome sum as our ransom.</p>

<p>The last time Troup came from Jellalabad, three
ponies were sent from thence loaded with different
articles for us: but money was put in one of the
boxes; and this was known to the Affghans in
charge; and ponies and all disappeared. I have
lost my letters from England and the provinces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
and from Sale; and also newspapers and medicine:
the latter invaluable; as we are very sickly, and
have scarcely any. A part of the things coming
were clothes for the captives, sent, by subscription,
from the provinces. But the medicine is our
greatest loss; as this gaol fever seems to be going
though all the party, ladies, children, officers,
men, and servants, both male and female. I think
it arises in great measure from malaria. This
valley is full of rice cultivation; which is all under
water in a stagnant state: and we are also devoured
by musquetoes, which breed there.</p>

<p>At first we hoped that though the money,
probably not more than 300 or 400 rupees, would
be abstracted from the boxes, we should recover
the parcels: but now we have give up that
hope.</p>

<p>A letter has been received by Ahmed Khan;
stating that every fort from Tighree to Buddeeabad
has been sacked by the force that have entered
the Lughman valley: some say they are a part of a
foraging party of ours; others conjecture that they
are our Sikh allies.</p>

<p>Should the Wuzeer attempt to remove us to
Bameean, Goolam Mahommed, the father of Taj
Mahommed, as also the latter, the high priest of
Cabul, and Khan Shireen Khan, have determined
to prevent it: but Khan Shireen Khan is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
the very man who had charge of the hostages
some time since; and assured them nothing should
induce him to give them up:&mdash;yet he did so the
very next day, on the Sirdar sending him 4000
rupees. So, much dependence cannot be placed
on <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The Kuzzilbashes ever side with the strongest
party; and therefore, if our troops come up, it is
likely that Khan Shireen Khan may keep his
word. He has many friends in the Huzara country,
through which we must pass; and he may
direct them to seize us. In that case we shall
probably, during the conflict with our guards, lose
the few comforts of clothing, &amp;c . which we now
possess.</p>

<p>A kafila is going down to Jellalabad; and at
the same time Akbar sends 2000 men towards
that place to line the passes. He sent 3000 some
time since; but their commander did not proceed
further than Bhoodkhak; whence he wrote to the
Wuzeer, that his force was too weak to cope with
Pollock's.</p>

<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;Reports that all the forts from
Tighree to Buddeeabad are destroyed.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;An earthquake.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Three more fever cases; and Conolly very
ill. We hear that immediately on Troup's arrival at
Jellalabad, all our outposts were withdrawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
Zeman Shah Khan's party is increasing again:
and it is thought, if our troops come up, that the
owner of the fort may side with us; and give us
arms to resist being taken away.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Mohun Lull says, that letters have
passed through his hands from several chiefs to
Gen. Pollock; stating, that if he will forbear from
injuring the city of Cabul, and respect their lives
and possessions, they will engage that we shall
not be taken from Cabul. Amongst these chiefs
are, the high priest, Zeman Shah Khan, Khan
Shireen Khan, and Goolam Mahommed Khan
(father of Taj Mahommed): the latter is in hopes,
should we obtain the ascendency, that he may
obtain office, as of old; his family being the hereditary
Wuzeers.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;John Conolly died, at thirty-two minutes
past noon. The Wuzeer has sent a Khan to
order his coffin; and offers to send the body to
Jellalabad.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Ahmed Khan informs us, that the baggage,
of the army at Kandahar, has been sent out
eight miles on the road towards the provinces;
and that our eighteen-pounders at Kandahar have
been destroyed. Some days since we had a report
that the force there, consisting, as the Affghans say,
of 8000 men, have been exterminated, with every
man, woman, and child thereunto appertaining;
and Kandahar taken and burnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
Three regiments have been sent from Kandahar
to reinforce Quetta; and the story concerning
the baggage is probably true; and Gen. Nott
has taken advantage of this force to send down
all superfluous baggage, and also the sick; preparatory
to a move upwards.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Camels have come; but none of them
are strong enough to carry the coffin; and they
say they will send mules at mid-day to carry it.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Major Pottinger arrived.</p>

<p>The Wuzeer refuses to allow Conolly's body to
go to Jellalabad until Troup returns; and then, if
all is not peace, he says he will not allow him to
go, alive or dead.</p>

<p>There is a report to-day amongst the Affghans,
that Pollock has written to say, that if it is attempted
to remove any one of us from Cabul, he
will lay the city in ashes.</p>

<p>We hear that the Kandahar force is coming up;
and it is expected that the one from Jellalabad
will do the same.</p>

<p>The Sappers and Miners have long been at
Charbagh; and they generally precede the army.</p>

<p>Conolly was buried at sunset in the garden of
the fort.</p>

<p>Hadje Bukhtian writes to his brother Ahmed
Khan, that Gen. Pollock has written to say it is
all one to him whether it is a day or a month; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
that immediately on the arrival of the prisoners he
will return to the provinces.</p>

<p>The servants have a report that we are forthwith
to be taken away, to, or towards, Bokhara.
For two days there have been eight camels here,
with their surwans ready; which looks as if the
Wuzeer meditated our removal, in case of the force
coming up; or to send us to our friends, should
the negotiation prove unsuccessful.</p>

<p>We heard to-day that the Sappers had advanced
as far as Gundamuk.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Troup and Lawrence arrived. I received
letters, &amp;c . from Sale. No present hope
of release: nor fear of a move, I trust. Nothing
appears to have been done beyond <i>talk</i>.
Pollock, has threatened, if we are not sent down
in eight days, to come up and destroy Cabul:
but Akbar knows, as well as he does himself, that
Pollock has no carriage. The 1st brigade are gone
to Jellalabad. Sale writes me, that, in addition
to it, he has with him the 3d dragoons and a troop
of horse artillery: but it does not appear that
they are coming up further. Indeed, without more
troops to back them, or rather to flank them, they
cannot come through the passes. They might do it
well with three brigades, having one on each flank
keeping the heights and adjacent country.</p>

<p>A durbar held by Mahommed Akbar, Mahommed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
Shah, &amp;c . to consult on the steps to be
taken regarding Futteh Jung, Amenoollah, the
Meerwyse, Zeman Shah, &amp;c . who all wrote advising
the immediate advance of our troops. A
letter from Futteh Jung to Gen. Pollock, to that
effect, had been intercepted: but, until Troup's
return, it was not safe to make any stir in the
affair.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;There was a report last night, that two
Europeans (officers) had been taken prisoners in
Cabul; having come from Kandahar, disguised as
natives of the country, with thirty followers: and
that they had been purchasing up all the gunpowder.</p>

<p>To-day it is said, the same persons are now with
the hostages; and that they are either adventurous
persons, who have come up from Nott's brigade,
for some purpose, as yet unknown; or that they
are part of the Ghuznee prisoners, attempting to
escape.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we heard that the above tale
has arisen out of the arrival of an Arab Hadje.
He calls himself a soldier of fortune; and offered
his services to Gen. Pollock; who declined them.
He is suspected of being a spy; and has just come
from Hindostan.</p>

<p>The deliberations in the durbar have ended in
Futteh Jung's being placed in confinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
<i>12th.</i>&mdash;All the hostages have come over to our
fort; and there is a talk of our being all sent
away,&mdash;some say to Soorkhab, four marches off,
on the confines of the Loghur country; others say
to the Kohistan, or Bameean.</p>

<p>We know that Sale's brigade, the 3d dragoons,
and a troop of horse artillery, were to leave Jellalabad
for Futteabad on the 6th; which would
bring them only fifteen miles nearer to us. The
women are being sent out of the city; and we
have packed up our little all, to be ready whenever
the <i>hookm</i> arrives: we have moreover purchased
two ponies.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;The republic has only endured a day.
Zeman Shah Khan is again Shah Zeman Shah.
We heard guns, probably in honour of the event.
This is news to mark my birthday; which is not
likely to be spent much as a <i>jour de fête</i> by a
prisoner.</p>

<p>I fear Zeman is too much in the hands of
Akbar and Mahommed Shah for him to do us
any good; although he is, and ever has been, well
disposed towards us: he acted with the greatest
kindness to the English left with him; and when
he had no longer power to protect them, and they
were forcibly taken from his house to that of
the Bucha Meerwyse or high priest of Cabul, he
took off his turban, placed it at his feet, and protested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">{397}</a></span>
against the measure: and finally sent his
eldest son with them; that, in case evil befel them,
his family should not shrink from sharing in it.
The priest's professions were great; but he ended
in giving the hostages up to Akbar for the value
of 4000 rupees. As they were sold for that sum,
we tell them they are Akbar's slaves.</p>

<p>There is now an idea,&mdash;whether only the fertile
emanations of prisoners' brains or not, time must
unfold,&mdash;but an opinion prevails, that Akbar is so
ungallant as to be heartily tired of dragging the
women and children about the country at his heels;
and that, if any flight is designed, it will be that of
himself and four hostages; Pottinger, Lawrence,
and Troup, to be decidedly three of them: we
are not so certain of the fourth; but at present
we have selected either Gen. Shelton or Capt.
Johnson.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;The news of to-day is, that Nott's force
has left Kandahar; taking Timor Shah with them.
They are said to have taken the route leading to
Dera Ismaël Khan; but it is thought possible they
may, about ninety miles from Kandahar, at <i>Gulnarye</i>,
strike to the north, and pursue that road to
Ghuznee; which would be far preferable to crossing
the mountains by the Gholary pass, near the
river, and that they will thence cross over to the
left again to the Abistadeh lake, and fall into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
regular road to Ghuznee at Mookkoor. This is a
wild and roundabout tract of country; which is
probably not feasible with guns. Akbar says, that
5000 men have been sent to oppose them. He
also says, that our force at Jellalabad is <i>in statu
quo</i>; but that if it moves up, we shall be sent off
at half an hour's notice, to a fine climate, with
plenty of ice; which we conclude to be Bameean.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;Futteh Jung has made his escape.</p>

<p>Our troops are reported to have made sixteen
marches from Kandahar. Akbar ordered 5000
men to go and meet them; but it is said, he has
mustered 400 only.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Smith (Mrs. Trevor's servant)
died of fever and water on the chest.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;We hear that the men, who went
towards Kandahar, have been beaten; and that
more are to be sent.</p>

<p>Futteh Jung escaped through a hole made in
the roof; from whence he let himself down by
a rope. The Wuzeer says he is gone to Tagow;
but the general opinion is that he is gone to
Jellalabad. Troup went to see the Wuzeer to-day;
who told him, he purposes sending for him
and Pottinger, to stay with him in the Bala
Hissar.</p>

<p>A thunder-storm at night, with heavy rain; the
lightning vivid; but it was all over in an hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
This storm was immediately preceded by an earthquake,
between 10 and 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Akbar has written to Lord Ellenborough to say
he will only treat with him; and that he will
not have any thing to do with Gen. Pollock;
who is "a fool!" This is complimentary.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;We heard a great deal of firing in the
evening.</p>

<p>Futteh Jung is said to have been taken on the
road to Jellalabad: but Abib Khan declares it is
not true. They also say that there has been a fight
at Gundamuk; that our troops have arrived there;
and that the Affghans have lost several men in
their defeat; that one of the fugitives has just arrived;
and that Akbar will send 5000 more men
there. They also say, that the Kandahar force is
within two marches of Ghuznee. Three horses
are kept ready saddled to start with messengers
at a moment's notice, night or day; and the Khan
says, he thinks we shall not be here more than
three days longer.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The late newspapers have not a little
amused me. They show that the editors catch at
every expression, used in any letters they have
read; or on any comments they hear on news from
Affghanistan. A regular controversy has arisen
between one, who asserts that Lady Sale in her
letters evinces a strong prepossession in favour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
Mahommed Akbar Khan, and another, who thinks
Lady Sale wrote, as she did, because she was a
prisoner: to which the first rejoins, that he does
not think Lady S. would, under any circumstances,
write that which was false. <i>There</i> he is
right: but I would not have written on the subject
at all, unless I wrote as I thought: if people
misunderstand, it is their fault and not mine.
Again, they say it were better I had never written
at all. Perhaps so: but it seems that details were
wanting; my letters to Sale gave those; and he
thought them of sufficient consequence to send them
to the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief.
They were afterwards sent to England by
the former; and, if the papers tell truth, excited
some attention in the highest circles. As to my
"great prepossession" in favour of Akbar, my
greatest wish is, that Gen. Nott's force should
march up to Ghuznee; release the prisoners there;
and then that a simultaneous movement should take
place of Nott's and Pollock's forces upon Cabul.
Once again in power, here, I would place Akbar,
Mahommed Shah, and Sultan Jan <i>hors de combat</i>;
befriend those who befriended us, and let the Affghans
have the Ameer Dost Mahommed Khan back,
if they like. He and his family are only an expense
to us in India; we can restore them, and make
friends with him. Let us first show the Affghans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
that we can both conquer them, and revenge the foul
murder of our troops; but do not let us dishonour
the British name by sneaking out of the country,
like whipped Pariah dogs. Affghanistan will become
a byword amongst the nations. Had we retreated,
as poor Sturt proposed, without baggage,
with celerity (forced marches to get through the
snow), and had the men stood by us (a doubtful
point,&mdash;they were so worn out and dispirited), we
might have figured in history; and have cut out
Xenophon's account of the retreat of the 10,000.</p>

<p>As to the justice of dethroning the Ameer
Dost Mahommed, and setting up Shah Shoojah,
I have nothing to say regarding it: nor regarding
our policy in attempting to keep possession of
a country of uncivilised people, so far from our
own; whence all supplies of ammunition, money,
&amp;c ., must be obtained. Let our Governors-General
and Commanders-in-chief look to that; whilst I
knit socks for my grand-children: but I have
been a soldier's wife too long to sit down tamely,
whilst our honour is tarnished in the sight and
opinion of savages. Had our army been cut to
pieces by an avowed enemy, whether in the field
or the passes&mdash;let them have used what stratagems
they pleased,&mdash;all had been fair. Akbar had shone
as another William Tell; he had been the deliverer
of his country from a hateful yoke imposed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
them by Kaffirs: but here he stands, by his own
avowal freely made, the assassin of the Envoy;&mdash;not
by proxy, but by his own hand. I do believe,
he only meant to make him prisoner; for the purpose
of obtaining better terms and more money:
but he is a man of ungovernable passions; and his
temper when thwarted is ferocious. He afterwards
professed to be our friend;&mdash;we treated
with him;&mdash;great was the credulity of those who
placed confidence in him: still they blindly did
so;&mdash;even after the letter was received from
Conolly, at Bhoodkhak, confirming the previous
warnings of his intentions towards us. He followed
us, with his bloodthirsty Ghilzyes. Mahommed
Shah Khan, his principal adviser, I might
almost say his master, is the most inveterate of our
enemies. Akbar is a jovial smooth-tongued man;
full of compliments and good fellowship; and
has the knack of talking over both kaffirs and true
believers.</p>

<p>To our cost, he did talk our chiefs over; and persuaded
them of his friendship; but said that those
sugs (dogs) of Ghilzyes were intent on murder
and plunder; and totally unmanageable. In this
way he hovered on our flanks and rear: and when
our people were massacred and his bloodhounds in
human shape were tolerably glutted with their
blood, the scene was changed; although it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">{403}</a></span>
constantly reacted. In the distance, a group of
horsemen invariably appeared: they were beckoned
to; questioned as to what chief was present,&mdash;it
was invariably Akbar, who always pretended
good faith, said his 300 horsemen were too few to
protect us from the Ghilzyes, &amp;c .,&mdash;and then, the
following day witnessed a repetition of the
slaughter, and pretended friendship; for that this
friendship was a mere pretence, was acknowledged
by him when he said, "I was the man who killed
your Envoy with my own hand; I destroyed
your army; I threw aside all ties of family, deserted
every thing, for the faith of Islam; and now I am
left to bear the opprobrium heaped on me by the
Feringhees, whilst no one supports me: but were
I in power, I would make the chiefs remember it!"
and then he uttered maledictions on their heads.
He has kept his word; has been a bitter enemy to
all who have shown the slightest kindness to us;
and grinds their money out of them by threats and
torture.</p>

<p>A woman's vengeance is said to be fearful; but
nothing can satisfy mine against Akbar, Sultan
Jan, and Mahommed Shah Khan. Still I say that
Akbar, having, for his own political purposes,
done as he said he would do&mdash;that is, destroyed
our army,&mdash;letting only one man escape to tell
the tale, as Dr. Brydon did,&mdash;and having got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
the families into his possession;&mdash;I say, having
done this, he has ever since we have been in
his hands, treated us well:&mdash;that is, honour
has been respected. It is true that we have not
common comforts; but what we denominate such
are unknown to Affghan females: they always
sleep on the floor, sit on the floor, &amp;c .&mdash;hardships
to us. We have bought common charpoys at two
rupees each; that is, a bed formed by four poles
and ropes tied across and across them. Had we
tables and chairs, we have not space for them; so
many inhabit the same apartment. Individually
I have no right to complain on this subject; as
Lady Macnaghten, Mrs. Mainwaring, Mrs. Boyd,
Mrs. Sturt, and I, occupy the same apartment.
Capt. Boyd makes his bed on the landing-place of
the stairs, or on the roof of the house; so that we
have no <i>man</i>-kind amongst us, except the Boyds'
two little boys, and Mrs. Mainwaring's baby.
This little fellow was born just before the insurrection
broke out in Cabul (in October): his father
had gone with Sale's brigade; and we always call
him Jung-i-Bahadur.</p>

<p>After so long enduring the misery of having
gentlemen night and day associated with us, we
have found this a great relief.</p>

<p>The Wuzeer gives us rations of meat, rice, ottah,
ghee, and oil; and lately fruit. At first our food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
was dressed for us; but it was so greasy and disgusting,
that we asked leave to cook for ourselves.
That again was a matter of taste: one person likes
what another does not. By us, a strong cup of
coffee is considered a luxury; whilst an Affghan
the other day, who had some given to him (he had
never tasted any before), pronounced it bitter
and detestable.</p>

<p>It is true, we have been taken about the country;
exposed to heat, cold, rain, &amp;c .; but so were
their own women. It was, and is, very disagreeable:
but still we are, <i>de facto</i>, prisoners; notwithstanding
Akbar still persists in calling us&mdash;honoured guests:
and, as captives, I say we are well treated. He
has given us common coarse chintz, and coarse
longcloth, too, wherewith to clothe ourselves;&mdash;I
must not use the word dress: and making up these
articles has given us occupation; increased by having
to work with raw cotton, which we have to
twist into thread for ourselves. We suffered more
from uncleanliness than any thing else. It
was above ten days after our departure from Cabul,
before I had the opportunity to change my
clothes, or even to take them off and put them on
again, and wash myself: and fortunate were those
who did not possess much live stock. It was
not until after our arrival here (at Spéwakee, near
Cabul) that we completely got rid of <i>lice</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
we denominated infantry: the fleas, for which
Affghanistan is famed (and particularly Cabul),
we call light cavalry.</p>

<p>The servants, of course, were worse off than
ourselves; and, not having as good wardrobes as we
had, communicated their pests, of the insect tribe,
to the children they carried about; and thus the
mothers obtained a double share. Bugs have
lately made their appearance; but not in great
numbers: the flies torment us; and the musquitoes
drive us half mad. But these annoyances, great
as they are, are the results of circumstances which
cannot be controlled; and when I say this, I suppose
I shall again be accused of prepossession in
favour of the Wuzeer. We ought, however, to bear
in mind, that the Affghans are not addicted to
general ablution: they wash their hands before
and after their meals, which is but <i>comme il faut</i>,
as they eat with their fingers; and they constantly
wear the same clothes a month. This is not economy.
The Wuzeer will take his bath perhaps once
a week; and change his clothes: and the women
never think of doing so oftener; and only open
their hair at such times; which is kept smooth
for that period by the application of gum to its
innumerable plaits. Here again is a difference
between their tastes and ours, who so enjoy
bathing twice a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
The garden, or rather vineyard and orchard, I
consider a great luxury: we walk in it every
evening for an hour or two. A strong guard is
placed there: but, except when it has been lately
changed, the men do not annoy us. At such times
they dodge about after us; but otherwise do not.
Last evening, for instance, sixteen men, armed at
all points, sat down in a row in the centre walk;
and laughed and joked together: five or six
were sitting eating grapes on the top of the
summer-house; and a few were posted, seated
on the walls; whilst we walked here and there
where we pleased.</p>

<p>When we have marched since we left Buddeabad,
Mahommed Shah's family, and some
others, have accompanied us; and the best
camels, largest kujavas, &amp;c ., have been selected
for them; and when carriage runs short,
they are served first. But this is only what we
must expect. Mahommed Shah Khan, too, preferred
Mrs. Sturt's riding-horse to his own; and
took it. Mine was sent to Jellalabad. When
Mackenzie went there, he rode, and lamed it; and
it was left behind. There I was fortunate; as Sale
has got it. Luckily I had a few rupees; and
the only day I was not provided with a horse
to ride, I hired one for two rupees six anas, a
mere baggage pony; but it carried me safely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
Nothing can exceed the folly I have seen in the
papers regarding my wonderful self;&mdash;how I
headed the troops, &amp;c . &amp;c . It puts me in mind of
Goldsmith's verses on Mrs. Blaze; in which he
remarks, that "the king himself has followed her,
when she has gone before:" and certainly I have
thus headed the troops; for the chiefs told me
to come on with them for safety sake: and thus I
certainly did go far in advance of the column; but
it was no proof of valour, though one of prudence.</p>

<p>Troup and Pottinger have been told to be in
readiness to go in to-morrow morning: so I now
make up my packet, in case an opportunity should
offer by which Troup can send it to Sale.</p>

<p>The only thing that has given me pleasure in
the Indian papers, is a subscription set on foot by
the civilians, to purchase a sword, to be presented
to Sale; because it shows that they appreciate his
conduct; and I know that he will value it most
highly. I hear that after Futteh Jung was placed
in confinement, his family had all their jewels,
&amp;c . taken away; to the value of twenty lakhs.
Some say this was done by Akbar and Sultan Jan;
others, by Mahommed Shah Khan. The latter had
taken a lesson in such actions, when he despoiled
Lady Macnaghten of her valuables.</p>

<p><i>22d August.</i>&mdash;Our friends went back to the
Wuzeer; and took my packets with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
The Affghans still talk of some defeat they
have experienced near Soorkhab: whence the
celebrated miner has returned discomfited and
wounded; and says he will not attempt to cope
with our force. The Wuzeer has made the people
of Cabul take their oath on the Koran to
stand by him; and great excitement prevails in
the city. Futteh Jung has arrived safely at
Jellalabad; and has written from thence, that, if
Akbar is his father's son, he will meet him in
fair fight; for which purpose there is said to
have been held a grand muster of troops on
the Siah Sung plain; amounting to 25,000
infantry and 5,000 horse, who are to be headed
by Akbar in person. I can scarcely believe that
he will set his fortunes on the issue of a battle.
A fair field and no favour is what we want: but he
would be mad to meet our disciplined troops on
the plain; when he knows that the fastnesses of
his country give him every advantage over us, with
any rabble he can collect. Besides, he is all but
supreme now. He wishes to be king: but Zeman
Khan has again got a strong party in his favour;
and is endeavouring to regain the throne.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;The prisoners from Ghuznee arrived
quite unexpectedly:&mdash;Col. Palmer, Capt. Burnett
(54th), Harris, Nicholson, Poett, Alston, Williams,
Crawford, and Thompson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
Akbar says, he will send us away in three or
four days, either to Bameean, Zoormut, or Soorkhab;
twenty miles off, on the borders of the
Loghur country.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Sultan Jan left Cabul with 300 men;
to reinforce Shumshudeen, who has been signally
defeated, we hear, at Carabagh; escaping with only
twenty men. Some say Nott's force achieved
this victory; but others that the Huzaras rose
against him: so probably British gold has been
weighed in the balance, and found more ponderous
than the hatred of the Kaffirs.</p>

<p>Being greatly in want of medicine, Mr. Campbell
went to the Sirdar to get some from Cabul;
and he told him we were to move to-night or to-morrow.
Mrs. Anderson, being too ill to travel,
remains here.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;A sudden order arrived for our removal;
with a report, that Futteh Jung's and all
the female royal family were to accompany us.
Capt. Troup arrived in the evening to see us
off, by Akbar's command. Mrs. Anderson, her
husband and children, remained at the fort.
Akbar has ordered every attention to be paid
to her and the gentlemen; Mr. Campbell being
left with the party to afford medical aid. Mrs.
Trevor and eight children are also left here, in
consequence of her being seriously ill with fever;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
as also one of her children. A man of the 44th
died of fever to-day; and was buried in the
garden. Soon after the moon rose we left the
fort; camels for kujavas and fifty ponies having
been sent for our accommodation. All our
ponies, &amp;c ., were taken from us; and on our removal,
a certain number were sent. We fortunately
purchased two ponies to carry our baggage.
We were told we were to go to Killa Kazi, about
seven miles from Cabul: but we made a long <i>détour</i>
to avoid the city; and crossed the Loghur river:
the road was very tolerable. After proceeding
about five miles we came to several forts on our
right; the first a large one; and were told it was
called Killa Kazi. We passed a succession of
forts on either side; but there was scarcely any
one to be seen except a few men watching their
grain heaps in the fields. On the right appeared
much cultivation; judging from the dark shade;
which, with an ill-defined line of irregular mountains,
was all we could even speculate upon in the
way of scenery. We had with us ten soldiers; so
ill with fever as to require to be carried in
kujavas: and Capt. Mackenzie and Lieut. Eyre
were also suffering.</p>

<p>I was the only lady who rode; the others preferring
the kujavas; on account of their children.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;At daybreak we were still travelling;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
and near sunrise found ourselves just opposite
to Cabul; and about two miles distant, as the crow
flies, from Baber's tomb. We saw the wall on the
hill quite distinctly. We did not arrive at our
ground till past seven: and took up our stations
under some trees near the fort; which, I have been
told, is called Kundah. Here there was no admittance;
as Sultan Jan was in it, with his reinforcements
for Ghuznee. This disproves a report
of yesterday; to the effect that the people of Cabul
had insisted on having Sultan Jan as a hostage for
our safety. He had a number of good horses
with him: and we recognised the Envoy's grey.
His army consisted of about thirty men; but
Inshallah! he is to be joined by lakhs. We are
said to be guarded by 1000 men; but 300 were
nearer the mark. During the morning we were
joined by Dr. Berwick, Lieut. Evans, and the
European soldiers who were left sick when we
evacuated Cabul: they form a total of thirty-seven;
but a few have been left for want of carriage,
which is to be furnished; and they are to be
sent after us; as also Lieut. Haughton. We this
morning recognised the summer-house above
Baber's tomb, Kerghah and the Pughman hills.</p>

<p>Judging from the time that we were travelling,
about twelve hours; and taking the rate of the
camels at about two miles per hour, deducting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
fourth for halt; we estimate the distance we have
gone at eighteen miles.</p>

<p>A letter has been received from Kandahar: Nott
has marched in three columns with only 6000 men.
He sent his camels out to graze the 3d March;
and lost 2000. He left Kandahar on the 28th.</p>

<p>Shumshudeen has retired on Ghuznee: and, by
the last accounts, Gen. Nott was within ten miles
of that fortress. He is expected at Cabul on the 1st.
Pollock's force is to move on the 20th. We are to
march at moon-rising. We witnessed a parade of
telling off the guards, &amp;c .; and heard the retreat
beat off at sunset. They use our drums and fifes;
and have some bugles with which they sound
for us to halt or advance. The sentries planted
round our camp are a perfect farce. These men are
the Pultans; who have no knives, and are mostly
armed with our own muskets: I saw them place
their pickets, in imitation of ours; and sentries
walked backwards and forwards, with a ramrod in
their hand; having stuck the butt end of the musket
in the earth at their posts: so that, were it of any
use, we might easily overpower them. We asked
to be admitted into the fort: but though they said
we might occupy one room when vacated by Sultan
Jan; after his departure, they insulted the gentlemen
who went to get it ready for us; and asked,
how the Kaffirs dared to wear their shoes there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
We, therefore, spread loonghees to form a shade,
as the heat was excessive; and at night it was very
cold. At eleven the <i>réveillé</i> was beat by the
drums, and performed by the pipes; a kind of
repetition of one, two, three: and at midnight we
were all ready to start.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;We left camp soon after midnight. The
Meer Akhor Ahmed Khan was very anxious that
all the riders should follow the advance guard of
half the infantry; the rest of which closed on our
rear: then came the kujavas, followed up by the
baggage; and their rear was closed by a strong
guard of Affghan cavalry.</p>

<p>Another body of horsemen, about twenty in
number, joined as riders; and kept near the Meer
Akhor; who desired Lady Macnaghten's kujavas
to be kept as the leading ones; and the camel had
fine trappings, as if to mark it particularly in case
of an attempt at escape.</p>

<p>We were between eight and nine hours on the
march over a barren broken slip of land, bounded
on either side by the hills for a considerable
distance, until we passed a fort and chokey at
Urghundee on our left; soon after which the road
turns off to the left to Ghuznee. The ascent to
Bala Maidan was long, but not difficult; and the
view from the top of it, looking down on the plain
above named, was very pretty; comprising a narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
valley, thickly studded with forts and diversified
by cultivation; with lines of willows and poplars
marking the water cuts; which here serve as hedgerows.
We were taken to a fort; but not admitted
into it: and after a time had tents pitched for us.
Lady Macnaghten, Mrs. Boyd and three children,
Mrs. Mainwaring and child, Mrs. Sturt and child,
and I, occupied one division of a Sipahee's pall:
there was another tent for the other ladies; two
more for the gentlemen, and one for the sick
soldiers.</p>

<p>We hear that Gen. Nott has arrived at Ghuznee,
has blown up the new bourj in the city, and
has put to death nearly every man, woman, and
child found there. We cannot be surprised at
the men taking signal vengeance; but we fear the
news is too good to be true. We met on our road
two horsemen; whom we supposed to be expresses.
We met, also, several camels, bullocks, and donkeys,
laden, for the most part, with assaf&oelig;tida.</p>

<p>It seems a plan was proposed this morning, and
negatived. I only heard of it by chance; so no
thanks are due for courtesy to those, who, had the
measure been carried, would have come to us for
our share. The plan was, to get Ahmed Khan to
make short marches, or halt; so as to allow Gen.
Nott to hear where we are, and rescue us: and
should it succeed, Ahmed was to receive two and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
a half lakhs. The scale before proposed was, I
believe, again to be brought forward: Lady
Macnaghten 10,000 rupees, Lady Sale 5000, Mrs.
Sturt 5000, Capt. and Mrs. Boyd and family
5000, &amp;c . This scale is said to be prepared according
to rank and means; which I deny: the
other captives are not wealthy any more than ourselves;
and where the money was to come from,
I know not. The Indian Government, it is said,
offered to ransom us for that sum; and I believe
would have given more: but this seems to have
been a private and most <i>zubberrdust</i> arrangement.</p>

<p>There is a report, that all Cabul is in confusion,
and the natives fighting against each other; and
that our force has passed Gundamuk.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;We left our encamping ground about
two o'clock; and reached Tarkhana between eight
and nine. Had I taken the ride for my own
amusement on a good horse, instead of being
driven about as a captive on a sorry baggage
yaboo, I should have enjoyed it very much. The
narrow vale we passed through was highly cultivated;
the fields divided by willow and poplar
trees, and the forts frequent. Near to Julraiz
(the head of the spring) the scenery was particularly
beautiful; the trees well clumped together;
and the river, here clear as crystal,
rapidly flowing to our left. The hills, also, assumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
a novel aspect; having a foreground of lower
hills of most uncommon form. Nearly opposite
to the town was a triangular one, sharp as though
it had been scarped purposely; next to it a semicircular
one, &amp;c .; with the usual chain of mountains
behind. Julraiz appears to be rather a
large town, surrounded by forts. The scenery
was varied; but the land always under cultivation
until we reached our halting ground; where we
bivouacked on the green sward, sheltered from the
sun's rays by a double row of poplar trees; between
which rippled a stream that empties itself
into the Cabul river, which bounds our resting-place
on one side. This river is at this place as
famed for its clear limpid waters, as it is at Cabul
for its dirty hue, being there quite red. We
here got some small fish like gudgeons, some bad
small apricots, sour grapes, and apples and pears,
that had just arrived by a caravan. Here General
Saleh Mahommed's troops looted five camels.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Marched at daybreak; and shortly afterwards
saw a curious stone on the hill to the left.
At about three miles passed Sir-i-chushm on the
right; a fortified town, with a fort in front of it.
Here are three preserves full of sacred fish. The
name of this place signifies the "head of the
spring." The road becomes daily more rugged.</p>

<p>On our right we passed a fine fort; called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
Mustapha Khan Ke Killa. It was built by a
person of that name. He is dead; but his son
lives there; a very gentlemanlike man, wearing
spectacles. As we passed he gave us <i>nan</i> (bread),
and apricots prepared as a paste.</p>

<p>We halted at Killa Naziri; eight miles from
our last resting-place. Here our troops again
looted two camels.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Marched at two <small>A.M.</small>, sixteen miles to
Gurdundewar, on the Helmund. At first we
passed through a narrow defile with a stony road;
after which the road was excellent, fit to drive
carriages upon; except in a few places where
there were rather awkward descents.</p>

<p>There were three steep ascents; one of which
was very long. Very little cultivation; and but
few forts seen on our route.</p>

<p>A man was met on the march, who said he was
a cossid from Ghuznee: that that fort was in
our possession; and that a force was to be sent to
release us.</p>

<p>Shortly before we arrived at our destination,
ten or twelve Huzaras were set upon by about
300 of our guard. They fired about fifty shots at
them: killed one, wounded one, took two prisoners,
and some loot.</p>

<p>There are two Yaghi forts here: the rest are
subject to Akbar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
<i>30th.</i>&mdash;Left the Hah-i-Baba to our left: there
was snow in the clefts; but none on the top,
which is 18,000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>We marched about eight miles to the foot of
the Hadje Gurk pass. The road led the whole
way through a defile; at first very narrow and
stony; with a tributary stream to the Helmund
occupying nearly the whole of it.</p>

<p>There were several rocks which assumed the
appearance of gigantic statues. One on the right
representing a man seated on a bull couchant:
another on the left, at first resembled a man
clothed in the <i>toga</i>, standing on a pedestal.
There were others, also, that it was difficult to
suppose natural: they may have been ancient
Buddhistic or Brahminic remains. After arriving
at some forts and two tombs near a ruined
fort, the valley became wider and fertile; being
all planted with wheat, some perfectly ripe and
some quite green.</p>

<p>On nearing our destination, the valley again
closed up. We came to a fort dilapidated, but
still inhabited. Every breach in the walls was
filled with armed men. Our troops were drawn
up in due form; our two drums and one fife
struck up; the bugle sounded at intervals; and
the men marched to this discord in the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
appropriate manner; invariably missing both cadence
and step, until we arrived at our tents.</p>

<p>Twice during the day's march there were shots
fired in front; and much talk of battle, which
never took place; though each time there were a
number of Huzaras posted on the heights. These
men have been for some time past besieging the
forts here. The damaged one has been partially
rebuilt; and the one opposite to it appears to be
in perfect repair.</p>

<p>Our commandant is going with his army to
fight: but I am not sure which side he takes.
There was a skirmish this morning; one party
posted behind a sungah on the hill, which was
forced, and the brave troops fled.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;Marched to the forts of Kaloo. Found the
road bad and stony; with constant steep ascents
and descents. Ascended the Hadje Gurk pass,
which is 12,400 feet above the level of the sea;
the hills barren; grain was cultivated in the bed
of the valley, where a silver serpentine stream
meandered; and the hay, freshly thrown into
cocks, reminded me of England. We crossed the
river twice; and with difficulty conquered a steep
ascent to the fort, near which we encamped. A
report that Akbar has been fighting with the
chiefs at Cabul; and that our force must be at
Bhoodkhak to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
<i>1st September.</i>&mdash;Marched at daylight over the
Kaloo pass. It is nearly four miles to the top of
it. The road at first is narrow and precipitous;
and for the most part little more than a steep
path. From the top the view is very grand; resembling
the waves of a very troubled sea, and
composed of barren hills of every variety of shade
and hue. We saw Bameean from thence: but
though a magnificent scene was before us, it presented
no pleasing object to those who expected
to remain captives in that desolate region. The
only plant here is the Koole-Huzara, or Huzara
Cass, a kind of furze that is very prickly, and
grows in bunches: it is used for fuel. As we
neared our destination (Killa Topchee), we entered
a very narrow but highly cultivated valley: the
grain short in the stalk, but particularly fine in
the ear. This day's march was seven miles.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;Marched at daylight seven miles to Bameean.
The road wild and uneven, with narrow
paths and many ascents and descents. This valley
is nowhere more than a mile broad; but it is very
fertile, and produces particularly fine grain. Plenty
of beans and pease are cultivated here; the former
very small, the latter small and hard. The tamarisk
and barberry were abundant, and a shrub
with yellow berries. We halted for a short time
opposite a fort, near which were many cows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
Here we got some mast (curds), which we found
very refreshing. Looking back from hence, we
saw Zohak behind us, on a high point. At Bameean
they refused to take us into the fort; and
we pitched our tents just under the ancient fortress
and city which were destroyed by Jhenzhis
Khan; when upwards of 300,000 persons perished.
The caves, ruins, and towers, extend for miles.
There are two large images which have been
described by former travellers: opposite to the
largest was our encampment.</p>

<p>We had scarcely settled ourselves in the tents
ere the General beat, in consequence of the people
of the fort and the regiment disagreeing: so we
went on about a mile, to such a wretched fort,
that we asked leave to remain in tents; which was
with difficulty obtained: but the Khan said he
would endeavour to get a better fort for us to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Saleh Mahommed Khan's lady came
to visit Lady Macnaghten. She is young and
fair, with a fat round face; and comes from
Loodianah; where, it is said, she was a dancing
girl. Her information is, that Futteh Jung
is a prisoner, or has been put to death: his
family, she says, are expected here in a day or
two.</p>

<p>From the 5th to the 9th we made excursions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
to see the caves, &amp;c . At first some difficulty was
made: but the General sent about thirty men to
guard us and our pencils; for several went intent
on sketching. I only copied the frescoes that were
on the walls and ceiling near the large image; but
Mr. Eyre made some very pretty and correct
sketches of Ghoolghoola (the ancient city), &amp;c .</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;I have daily been begging hard for permission
to go and see the ancient city; but am at
last put off by a direct refusal: the soldiers, it
seems, are overworked in keeping watch over us
in camp; and to relieve them we are to be taken
into one of these horrid forts.</p>

<p>We went to the fort formerly occupied by Dr.
Lord.</p>

<p>Long ago, to prevent a recurrence of disputes
which had formerly arisen amongst us regarding
distribution of accommodation, &amp;c ., we elected,
by vote, a committee of three gentlemen, whose
fiat was indisputable&mdash;Major Pottinger, and
Capts. Webb and Lawrence: the latter also undertook
to be our purveyor; portioning out our
rations generally with his own hands (servants
being scarce), as well as the food for the soldiers.</p>

<p>On our going into the fort, the committee,
having examined the miserable sheds built round
the square of high walls with corner towers
and a gateway, at first decided that the five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
best rooms, or rather most convenient ones as
regarded privacy, &amp;c ., should be destined for the
ladies; and we were to draw lots for them, or
arrange amongst ourselves. Finally, it was requested
that the choice might go by seniority. Lady
Macnaghten of course had the first choice. I had
the second; and took a dark cow-house; the only
light admitted being from a door down a long
narrow passage and a hole in the roof. This was
for Mrs. Sturt, myself, the ayah, and <i>the dog</i>; and
was decidedly the best apartment there, to my
taste. We soon <i>set to</i>: and by dint of hard working
with sticks and stones, in which I bore my part,
assisted by Mr. Melville until both of us got blistered
hands, we knocked two small windows out
of the wall; and thus obtained darkness visible.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;We were fortunate in our selection;
although our nightly visitant, in the shape of the
largest bug I ever saw, was sufficiently disgusting:
but Lady Macnaghten, Captain and Mrs. Boyd,
and Mrs. Mainwaring, with the children, had no
rest in the three rooms they had taken; which all
communicated with each other. They had capital
<i>shikar</i> all night: and in the morning got leave to
pitch a tent at the gate, and reside there.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;When we were at Tai Khana on our
way to this place, a Sipahee came to us and
said that there were about fifty Hindostanees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
amongst our guard, who were willing to join us;
and that Saleh Mahommed Khan was a man who
would do any thing for money. This was told to
Capts. Johnson and Lawrence; and they agreed
to sound him on the subject; which they did: but
he laughed at their offer; and pretended to imagine
they were only joking.</p>

<p>This morning early, Capt. Lawrence came to
ask if we would allow a conference to take place
in our room, as being the most private place. We
assented. Saleh Mahommed Khan, the Syud
Morteza Khan, Major Pottinger, Capts. Lawrence,
Johnson, Mackenzie, and Webb, assembled; and
our bed, spread on the floor, formed the divan.
Here in the course of an hour all was settled. The
gentlemen present signed their names to the paper;
in which we promised to give Saleh Mahommed
Khan 20,000 rupees, and to insure him 1000 rupees
a month for life; and that if the government did
not extricate us from this difficulty, we would
be answerable for the money. Thus they held
the promise of five British officers as sacred. In
heading the paper, they insisted that we should do
so in the name of Christ; as rendering it perfectly
binding. Saleh Mahommed declared to us, that
he had received orders to remove us farther (to
Khooloom), and to set out that night: also, that he
had another letter from Akbar, ordering all who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
were not able to march to be put to death. He
seems anxious that we shall not receive any news
from others; and had his two drummers severely
flogged, for telling us that the Kuzzilbashes with
Khan Shireen Khan had risen against Akbar, and
that the latter had fled to the Kohistan.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Saleh Mahommed Khan hoisted the
standard of defiance on the walls,&mdash;white, with a
crimson edge and green fringe.</p>

<p>Two Huzara chiefs have tendered their allegiance
to Major Pottinger; as also Zulficar Khan,
the Naïb of the province, who, we heard, had fled.
Another man has been appointed in his room; and
has paid 1000 rupees to Saleh Mahommed for his
appointment: which money was laid out in purchasing
khelluts (for the chiefs who came in to us)
from a Kaffila fortunately passing by.</p>

<p>A report that the Andersons, Trevors, and Bygrave
have got safe to our troops: but as this is
coupled with Troup's having gone to Ghuznee, we
fear it is not true; more especially as we are told
that our force is still on the other side of the
Khoord Cabul pass; and the last accounts from
Ghuznee are, that Gen. Nott was one march on
the other side of it.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;A large party travelling by, supposed
to be the Meer Hadje and his family. Saleh
Mahommed Khan determined to seize them. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
pulled the Moollah off his horse; who only proved
to be a Sheikh somebody, a relation of the Hadje's;
so they were all <i>bien quittés pour la peur</i>, and proceeded
on their way in double quick. There is a
talk of arming our men, if we can get muskets.
Our valley is now almost hermetically sealed at
both ends. Akbar is at Bégram in the Kohistan;
the Meer Hadje and Zeman Shah Khan quiet
at Cabul.</p>

<p>The Meer Akhor went off at night with his
Juzailchees; taking with him sundry ashurpees
which he had received from myself and others to
change for us. This is particularly inconvenient;
as we are about to purchase all the ottah procurable,
in order to lay in a little commissariat of our own;
and, if Akbar sends troops against us, hold out till
our own people come to relieve us. We have appointed
Capt. Johnson our commissariat officer.</p>

<p>Kurrim Beg came over to us, and Meer Hassun;
and with much form and ceremony swore on the
Koran to be faithful to us. The latter is the person
whose fort Dr. Lord burnt; and on which subject
there was much angry discussion, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,
in the Indian papers. He offered his fort to us: it
has a name, which the wits pronounce as <i>fool-hardy</i>;
and say it is synonymous with our attempt. The
only persons who are against the measure are
Gen. Shelton and Col. Palmer. As the latter has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
already been tortured at Ghuznee, he possibly fears
a repetition of barbarity, should we not succeed.
The former says, we are precipitating matters with
Akbar; whom he considers as our friend. I believe
both have at length signed the paper. They could
scarcely do less; as our signatures were to exonerate
the five officers whose names were superscribed
as answerable for the whole account, which we
were of course to pay our shares of.</p>

<p>I wrote to Sale to-day; informing him of our
resolution to hold out till we received assistance,
even should we be reduced to eating the rats and
mice; of which we have a grand stock.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Zulficar Khan, Salamid Khan, and other
chiefs, joined us.</p>

<p>It would be great injustice to Major Pottinger
not to mention the active part he took in affairs.
From his perfect knowledge of the Persian language,
and his acquaintance with the manners and
customs of the people, he well knew how to
manage them, and take advantage of the slightest
opening on their part in our favour. His coolness
and decision were only equalled by the promptness
with which he met the wishes of the chiefs; giving
them <i>barats</i> on the neighbouring lands, empowering
them to receive the government rents, &amp;c .; all
which documents, though he executed them with
an air of great condescension and with the gravity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
of a judge, he well knew were mere pieces of
waste paper: yet they had a magic charm for the
time; which was all we required. I had again
an opportunity of writing to Sale; as another
messenger is sent, in case the first should not
reach his destination.</p>

<p>At night we were roused by the sounding of
the cracked trumpet, and the drums beating to
arms; which, in our <i>yaghi</i> (rebellious) position,
was a little astounding. It seems that a body of
horsemen were hovering about the ruins near
the images; and were suspected to be some of
Akbar's troops. Saleh Mahommed sent out his
men in skirmishing order, or rather disorder:
however, it answered our purpose; for, whoever
they were, they <i>made themselves scarce</i>.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;A letter was received from some one,
whose signature in cypher was not to be made out;
stating that all Cabul had risen against the
Wuzeer; that Nott's force was at Maidan last
Wednesday, and Pollock's at Bhoodkhak; that
Akbar had fled to the Toba mountains towards
Kandahar to the Ghilzyes, and Shumshudeen
Khan to the Kohistan.</p>

<p>Another letter came from Mohun Lull, corroborating
the account of the insurrection in Cabul.
He himself had fled to the Kuzzilbash quarter
with his family: Zeman Khan had fled to either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
the Kohistan or Kuzzilbash quarter; and the
Kuzzilbashes have taken a decided part in the
business. A light force is said to have been sent
to our aid: it is therefore decided that we are to
march to-morrow; taking with us two kurwahs of
ottah, which is all (out of four) that we can carry;
being very short of cattle. This ottah was purchased
by the subscription I before mentioned.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;We marched to Killa Topchee on a fine
sunshiny morning; which we hailed as a presage of
the future. We were not, however, without considerable
anxiety; for our present state was replete
with danger. We had every reason to believe
that the Meer Akhor, on leaving us, had gone to
Akbar, and revealed our plans; and consequently
every man we saw was suspected to be the <i>avant
courier</i> of troops sent to reclaim us: and the cheering
hope of an escape was considerably clouded
before we had been an hour on the road. Those
who travelled in kujavas, of course, could not keep
pace with those who rode: our equestrian party, of
which I formed one, had halted; and, to screen
themselves from the sun, had taken shelter under
some huge masses of rock. Here Saleh Mahommed
Khan came up to us; and speaking in Persian to
Capt. Lawrence, told him that he had succeeded in
getting a few muskets; which, together with ammunition,
he had brought with him on a camel: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
requested that he would ask the men, which of
them would take them; it being his wish to form a
small advance guard of Europeans, as a <i>show</i>. Capt.
Lawrence then said, "Now, my lads, here's Saleh
Mahommed Khan has brought arms and ammunition
for some of you: who volunteers to take
muskets?"</p>

<p>I blush to record, that a dead silence ensued.
Thinking the men might be shamed into doing their
duty, I said to Lawrence, "You had better give
<i>me</i> one, and I will lead the party;" but there was
still no offer: and he told our General, that it was
useless; and he had better take them on. It is
sad to think the men were so lost to all right
feeling.</p>

<p>We encamped near the small forts. Here a
letter was received; stating, that on Tuesday
Pollock's force fought from mid-day to midnight;
and eventually forced the Khoord Cabul pass,
charging the enemy as far as the hills north of
Cabul to the Jurra Tunghee, leading to Tagow;
that on Wednesday morning Nott attacked and
pursued the enemy as far as Siah Sung; that
meanwhile the Kuzzilbashes seized the city, and
partially looted it.</p>

<p>Mahommed Akbar Khan and Mahommed Shah
Khan are said to be&mdash;<i>nowhere</i>!</p>

<p>Sultan Jan and Shumshudeen Khan had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
previously defeated at Maidan; as also Sultan
Ahmed Khan.</p>

<p>Reports have just arrived that 2000 horse from
Khoolloom are following us up to take us thither.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;At two in the morning we were roused
by the arrival of a horseman with a letter from
Sir Richmond Shakespear; who is coming with
600 Kuzzilbash horsemen to our aid.</p>

<p>We marched eleven miles to the forts at the
foot of the Kaloo pass; again admiring the silvery
serpentine stream and the haycocks near it. We
arrived at our ground at mid-day, and were sitting
under the walls of one of the forts, sheltering
ourselves from the sun until the arrival of our
tents; when, at three o'clock, Sir Richmond arrived;
and was received, with <i>one</i> exception, with
heartfelt pleasure. That one, Gen. Shelton, could
not forget the honour due to his rank as the
senior military man; and was much offended at
Sir R. not having called on him first, and reported
his arrival in due form. Even were this a
military duty, Sir Richmond was perfectly exonerated
in its omission; for the greater part of
us ladies and some gentlemen had seated ourselves
where he must pass, anxious to offer our acknowledgments
to him for his prompt assistance.</p>

<p>He told us, that Gen. Nott had gained two
victories on the 28th and 30th, at Ghuznee and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
Maidan; and that Gen. Pollock had beaten
Akbar at Jugdaluk and Tézeen. He also, most
considerately, informed me of Sale having been
struck by a spent ball without injury; and congratulated
me on our gracious Queen's bestowal
of the highest order of the Bath upon my gallant
husband;&mdash;a distinction, I believe, unparalleled
in his present rank; and therefore the more dearly
prized.</p>

<p>We now have accounts we can depend upon
of the position of our armies. Pollock is encamped
at Siah Sung; and Nott expected to march
on to Cabul to-morrow. Akbar is supposed to
have taken refuge in the Ahmedzye country.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;We marched to Gundundewar over a
very stony road, having a serpentine river on our
left. Crossed the Hadje Gurk pass; which is at
an elevation of 12,400 feet above the level of the
sea; but lower than Kaloo, which is 14,000. At
the end of the pass, the river appears to gush
through immense portals of solid rock.</p>

<p>During this march, many curiously formed
rocks were seen at a distance; one bearing a
strong resemblance to a giant climbing up the
precipice; another, so perfect when near, as to
render one doubtful whether the bull couchant
was not the remains of ancient Hindu sculpture.
We did not fail to drink of the mineral spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
as we passed it; and whilst so employed, attracted
the attention of a party of Affghans; to whom
Major Pottinger recommended a hearty draught of
this sparkling liquid; which, however pleasing to
the eye, is far from being so to the palate; being
very like ink. The grave Affghans drank a full cup
of it; exclaiming, "Shookr!" and "Joor Ustie;"&mdash;praise
be to God! and they would grow strong
upon it. They then stroked down their beards; and
wended their way with great satisfaction. The
latter part of our road lay among a narrow path,
on either side of a tributary stream, bounded by
a high and precipitous range of slatestone rocks.
We soon came to the Helmund; which we crossed,
and encamped on its bank. Nearly opposite to us,
a part of the rocks presented the form of a seated
figure of Boodh.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;We marched two hours before daylight,
and crossed the Onai Kotul; a succession of
ascents and descents, and some of them very
steep, ending in a defile: after which the road
was very stony. The grain was still green in
many parts; but some of it was not only cut but
carried away. We passed Killa Onai, Killa
Suffard, and Killa Mustapha Khan: at the latter,
breakfast was prepared;&mdash;<i>nan</i> (native sweet
cakes) and tea for all who chose to partake of it
<i>en passant</i>. The proprietor of this fort is a friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
of Saleh Mahommed Khan's; and had given us
bread and preserved fruit as we passed before.
From hence we went on to Sir-i-Chushm; and
diverged from the road to see the preserve of fish
there. I asked the name of the fish; but all they
knew was that they were fish; that they were held
sacred, and fed; and that any one who caught, or
even touched, one would die shortly afterwards.
The streams were very clear, and the fish innumerable.
Four miles from this place we took up
our old ground under the poplar trees at Tarkhana.
We were not yet considered as safe even here,
and Sir Richmond Shakespear felt much anxiety
at not receiving any accounts of troops coming
to our aid; as he had written to Gen. Pollock to
send a brigade to meet us. As Sultan Jan was
believed to be hovering near, there were some
thoughts of our going into a fort: however it was
decided that we should remain in our tents.</p>

<p>We had proceeded but a short way on our
journey, when a horseman arrived with a note informing
us, that Sale was close at hand with a
brigade. I had had fever hanging about me for
some days; and, being scarce able to sit on my
horse, had taken my place in a kujava; the horrid
motion of which had made me feel ten times worse
than before I entered it. But this news renovated
my strength. I shook off fever and all ills; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
anxiously awaited his arrival, of which a cloud of
dust was the forerunner. Gen. Nott was near
Urghundee, and consequently close to us; and
Gen. Pollock requested he would send a brigade
to our assistance. This he refused, much to the
disgust of his officers, alleging that his troops were
fatigued. On this, Gen. Pollock sent Sale with
a brigade, at a few hours' notice. He left Siah
Sung two miles east of Cabul; and made a forced
march on the 19th (his sixtieth birthday) to Urghundee:
he halted there that night; and on the
following morning left his camp standing, and
marched to meet us. At the pass near Kote Ashruffee
he left his infantry to hold the position, and
proceeded at the head of the 3rd dragoons. A
party of Sultan Jan's men were in this neighbourhood;
and some Kokhes in the immediate vicinity
were driven off by the Juzailchees. Had we
not received assistance, our recapture was certain:
but as it was, they dared not attack the force they
saw. It is impossible to express our feelings on
Sale's approach. To my daughter and myself
happiness so long delayed, as to be almost unexpected,
was actually painful, and accompanied
by a choking sensation, which could not obtain
the relief of tears. When we arrived where the
infantry were posted, they cheered all the captives
as they passed them; and the men of the 13th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
pressed forward to welcome us individually. Most
of the men had a little word of hearty congratulation
to offer, each in his own style, on the restoration
of his colonel's wife and daughter: and then
my highly-wrought feelings found the desired
relief; and I could scarcely speak to thank the
soldiers for their sympathy, whilst the long withheld
tears now found their course. On arriving at
the camp, Capt. Backhouse fired a royal salute
from his mountain train guns: and not only our
old friends, but all the officers in the party, came
to offer congratulations, and welcome our return
from captivity.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;We marched to Killa Kazee; and great
was the contrast of our present happiness and comfort,
compared with what our state had been, when
we last bivouacked under the trees at this place.
The obnoxious fort was deserted; but the troops
obtained forage there; and the place was destroyed
by fire: as also a fort of Sultan Jan's. But guards
were sent to the Kuzzilbash forts near us, to
protect the property of our friends. A reward
has been offered for Capt. Bygrave, and it is supposed
he will be brought in to us shortly. At
three o'clock we resumed our march to Cabul;
and passed through the great bazaar; where the
shops were shut, and all looked very desolate, and
unlike the busy city it was when we were here last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
year, and the inhabitants found their trade prosper
under our rule. We were greeted, on our arrival
at the camp at Siah Sung, with a salute of twenty-one
guns.</p>

<p>And now my Notes may end. Any further
journals of mine can only be interesting to those
nearly connected to me.</p>

<h2>ADDENDA.</h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 20th of October, the Envoy wrote to
Sir Alexander Burnes, in consequence of information
he had received from Capt. Trevor, which
indicated an unquiet state of feeling among the
people of Cabul. But Sir A. Burnes, on whom
the intelligence department devolved, assured him
that Trevor must be mistaken; as <i>he</i> knew nothing
of any meditated rising of the people: and
that all was as it ought to be. Notwithstanding
this, Trevor assured the Envoy that a number of
Ghilzye chiefs had left Cabul for hostile purposes.</p>

<p class="gap-above">On the 1st of November, Sir A. Burnes congratulated
Sir William on the prospect of soon
leaving Cabul in a perfect state of tranquillity.
We might attribute his anxiety to calm the Envoy's
mind, by assurances of the peaceful feelings
of the people of the country, to anxiety on his
part to succeed to the situation to be vacated by
Sir William: but it appeared questionable whether
he would permanently have done so; as Col.
Sutherland had, it was said, been nominated for
the appointment.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
There can be no doubt, from what we have
since heard from the Affghans, that Sir A. Burnes
wrote to Sir William Macnaghten for a regiment:
and that no aid was given, either to him or Trevor,
Anquetil or Mackenzie, is well known. Where
the blame rests, it is not for <i>me</i> to determine.</p>

<p class="gap-above">Not only did Taj Mahommed Khan, but also
the Naïb Shureef, warn Sir Alexander. The latter
was very intimate with him; and they were both
well known to most of those officers who at all
associated with the Affghan gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mention is made of the Naïb in one of the
Bombay papers; in which he is represented as a
very respectable person,&mdash;a Naïb in Capt. Johnson's
office. Khan Shireen Khan is the head of the
Kuzzilbashes; and Mahommed Shureef was his
Naïb, or the governor under him;&mdash;a man of large
estates; who, from his adherence to our cause, has
had to fly his country, with what little he could
save; but leaving landed property, worth above
two lakhs of rupees, to the mercy of his enemies,
the Barukzyes. Naïb Shureef paid a large sum
for the interment of the bodies of Burnes and his
brother. It was asserted that he was deceived, but
his intention was equally good. After the return
of the British force to Cabul, the bodies were
reinterred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
Taj Mahommed Khan and Naïb Shureef have
both paid every attention in their power to the
hostages, left in Cabul: and, as far as regards
Mrs. Sturt and myself, they sent us, whenever
they could obtain a secret conveyance, various little
comforts. Tea, sugar, stockings, gloves, and money
we received: and much, which they sent, never
reached us.</p>

<p>Taj Mahommed Khan is the son of Gholam
Mahommed Khan; who formerly assisted Shah
Shoojah in his fruitless attempt to gain the
throne. His family were long the hereditary
Wuzeers of the country. That family are so influential,
that they can hold their ground with all
parties. We leave him in the Wuzeerat. Jan
Fishan Khan is now, as he says, only the poor
Syud Mahommed. Two of his brothers have
fallen in battle: one son was burnt alive, when a
child: another has had his throat cut; though he
begged hard for life, stating that he was a little
child, and never could have harmed any one. The
wretched father, with the remnant of his family,
accompanies us to India. He never was rich.
He possessed lands in the Pughman valley; a
fertile vale, with magnificent vineyards and orchards.
Despoiled of them, he is all but a beggar;
but looks for the favourable consideration of the
Government of India.</p>

A trifling subscription was raised by Sale and
some officers, to enable him to purchase camels,

<p class="gap-above">In reading over these Notes, I believe I have
not done justice to some of the men who were our
fellow-captives. The day after that on which
Saleh Mahommed Khan offered them the arms,
a few men of the artillery, and perhaps, in all,
half a dozen others, asked for and obtained them.
Swords were difficult to procure for the officers:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
Lieut. Eyre, not being able to get one, took a
musket; which was very troublesome and heavy;
as, from the wound he received at Cabul, he has
lost the use of one hand.</p>

<p class="gap-above">It is now said, that though we all at the
time believed Saleh Mahommed's assertion, that
Akbar ordered the death of those who could not
march, it is probable that this was a fiction. No
one actually <i>read</i> the letter, that I can discover:
and he probably wished to enhance the value of
his releasing us. The order for our being sent to
Khoolloom was read by several of the officers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here follow copies of a few notes that have
been recovered. The first is not dated; but, if I
mistake not, I have made allusion to the order for
cutting away the weeds that grew on the ramparts;
lest they should facilitate the enemy's entrance
into the cantonments. The Affghans had
first to cross the ditch, twenty feet wide.</p>

 <p class="number">No. I.</p>

 <p class="center">TO LIEUT. STURT.</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the breastwork on the Musjid been
 improved? This Lieut. Sturt was to have done yesterday.
 It must be, and as effectually as circumstances
 will admit, done to-day.</p>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
 The bridge at the rear gate does not seem to be
 understood. The planks must be always kept ready
 to lay down. The breach of the captured fort ought
 to be strengthened. (The officer must be told, on the
 appearance of any people near it, to warn them off,
 and immediately let a party fall in near it); this latter
 does not apply to Lieut. Sturt.</p>

 <p>Can any thing be done to the magazine or other
 forts during this quiet day?</p>

 <p>Weeds on ramparts to be cut.</p>

 <p>My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my return from the Envoy's I heard you
 had taken out a gun at the Bazar fort. I hope there
 is no risk, although I feel rather uneasy about its
 having been done before the work for its protection
 was completed; but as it has been done, you must look
 to the work, and carry it on without the least delay.
 See that this is carried on.</p>

 <p>I was not aware you intended to take it out, and I
 hear the Brigadier was opposed to it. I hope, however,
 for to-night the gun is safe: to lose it would be
 disastrous.</p>

 <p>My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is deemed too bad that we should suffer
 ourselves to be bullied in the way we have been to-day
 outside the Siah Sung gate, to say nothing of people
 being fired at every night coming to us with supplies;
 therefore it is determined that you throw up some
 sort of flêche, or other work, to hold a dozen men or
 so, which would keep these fellows at a more respectable
 distance, protect our animals and camp followers,
 save our bridge, and do away with the necessity of a
 cavalry piquet. If we have a quiet night, the General
 wishes you would plan out such a work on paper, and
 have it marked out on the ground, ready for the 200
 Sappers and Miners to commence on the first thing in
 the morning, and as many other workpeople as can
 be got. The Brigadier has spoken to you about a
 trench across the road from our ditch to the Captured
 fort. [No. 1.] The enemy set us a good example last
 night. You must have thought it necessary when you
 went to it and returned this evening.</p>

 <p>Another line for the last-named trench is mentioned,

 the S.W. angle.</p>

 <p>My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rear of the old commissariat godown the
 rebels have prepared a platform to-day, about twelve
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
 feet by four. Hay says they were looking at them all
 day from the Bala Hissar; that they began it at about
 one <small>P.M.</small>, and seemed to have finished it before dark,
 and left it then; and that they seemed to be trying it,
 by walking on it, before they went away; it seemed to
 be a contrivance for crossing our ditch. The enemy
 appeared more numerous to-day than for some days
 past.</p>

 <p>My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we the means, by taking the beams of
 some building, of making a bridge over the canal?
 and how long would it take?</p>

 <p>The guns, I fear, cannot cross otherwise, or the
 carriages for the bridge over the river.</p>

 <p>The scarping the bank of the canal would render
 it practicable for the cavalry and baggage, and save
 some time. How long will it take to complete the
 opening for the egress of the troops? Pray attend
 to all this. I have told Pottinger to ask for a guard
 to protect our party; but the bridge might be prepared
 directly, ready to lay down the morning we go.
 Send for the Sappers, and see what you can do as to
 this. How many bullocks will be required to draw
 the carriages to the river? This we must get assistance
 to do just before we march.</p>

 bridge of gun-carriages, which was effected the day
 we started (the 6th of January).]</p>

 <p>My dear Sturt,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General wishes to know what you have
 done about cutting a passage through the rampart for
 our exit; if the Sappers are unable to do the job, you
 might have an European working party, if you will
 let me know the number you require; and the work
 should be done to-night, if possible.</p>

 <p class="number">No. VII.</p>

 <p>My dear Grant,</p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A party of forty Europeans with the regular
 Sappers will do the job in about three hours: all
 inside is cleared away.</p>

 <p>I cannot help giving the warning before doing this
 to-night. If we do not march to-morrow, we shall
 want a gun and a very strong guard, to prevent the
 Ghazeeas entering.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the General is not aware that about 500
 men were on the point of forcing the gate to-day,
 and, being prevented, tore up the remaining portion
 of the canal bridge, which now no longer exists.
 While giving this warning, I have ordered the work
 to be begun now; therefore, if it is desired to be
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
 stopped, send to me; if not, send the Europeans. I
 am not answerable if accident happens, as I now wish
 you to tell the General that, in my opinion, no other
 than concealed measures should be used for moving
 out, until a few hours before that event takes place.
 If we march to-morrow, it should be done or commenced
 now; if not, it is my deliberate advice&mdash;do
 not execute it, or you endanger cantonments.</p>

<p class="gap-above">When Istalif was taken, the book of Gen. Elphinstone's
Orders was found there.</p>

<p>To show how inaccurately it was kept, I am
told, by those who saw it, that the orders of the
11th and 12th were inserted before those of the
10th of December. The book was made over
to General Pollock; and does not agree with
General Elphinstone's last memoranda regarding
Brigadier Shelton; as he is there thanked for the
assistance always given by him to General Elphinstone.</p>

<p>The forces at Ghuznee and Kandahar to quit those
places as soon as the season would admit of their
marching.</p>

<p>12. The Sirdars, Mahommed Akbar Khan and
Osman Khan, or any other chiefs wishing to do so, to
accompany the troops on their march to Peshawer.</p>

<p>13. Four hostages to be given by us for the full

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
